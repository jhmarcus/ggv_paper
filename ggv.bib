	Abstract = {Establishing the age of each mutation segregating in contemporary human populations is important to fully understand our evolutionary history and will help to facilitate the development of new approaches for disease-gene discovery. Large-scale surveys of human genetic variation have reported signatures of recent explosive population growth, notable for an excess of rare genetic variants, suggesting that many mutations arose recently. To more quantitatively assess the distribution of mutation ages, we resequenced 15,336 genes in 6,515 individuals of European American and African American ancestry and inferred the age of 1,146,401 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We estimate that approximately 73% of all protein-coding SNVs and approximately 86% of SNVs predicted to be deleterious arose in the past 5,000-10,000 years. The average age of deleterious SNVs varied significantly across molecular pathways, and disease genes contained a significantly higher proportion of recently arisen deleterious SNVs than other genes. Furthermore, European Americans had an excess of deleterious variants in essential and Mendelian disease genes compared to African Americans, consistent with weaker purifying selection due to the Out-of-Africa dispersal. Our results better delimit the historical details of human protein-coding variation, show the profound effect of recent human history on the burden of deleterious SNVs segregating in contemporary populations, and provide important practical information that can be used to prioritize variants in disease-gene discovery.},

	Abstract = {Multivarate techniques can be used to condense the information for a large number of loci and alleles into one or a few synthetic variables. The geographic distribution of synthetic variables can be plotted by the same technique used in mapping the gene frequency of a single allele. Synthetic maps were constructed for Europe and the Near East, with the use of principal components to condense the information of 38 independent alleles from ten loci. The first principal component summarizes close to 30% of the total information and shows gradients. Maps thus constructed show clines in remarkable agreement with those expected on the basis of the spread of early farming in Europe, thus supporting the hypothesis that this spread was a demic spread rather than a cultural diffusion of farming technology.},

	Abstract = {Animal migrations are often spectacular, and migratory species harbor zoonotic pathogens of importance to humans. Animal migrations are expected to enhance the global spread of pathogens and facilitate cross-species transmission. This does happen, but new research has also shown that migration allows hosts to escape from infected habitats, reduces disease levels when infected animals do not migrate successfully, and may lead to the evolution of less-virulent pathogens. Migratory demands can also reduce immune function, with consequences for host susceptibility and mortality. Studies of pathogen dynamics in migratory species and how these will respond to global change are urgently needed to predict future disease risks for wildlife and humans alike.},

@article{Chen:2012dz,
	Abstract = {Many disease-susceptible SNPs exhibit significant disparity in ancestral and derived allele frequencies across worldwide populations. While previous studies have examined population differentiation of alleles at specific SNPs, global ethnic patterns of ensembles of disease risk alleles across human diseases are unexamined. To examine these patterns, we manually curated ethnic disease association data from 5,065 papers on human genetic studies representing 1,495 diseases, recording the precise risk alleles and their measured population frequencies and estimated effect sizes. We systematically compared the population frequencies of cross-ethnic risk alleles for each disease across 1,397 individuals from 11 HapMap populations, 1,064 individuals from 53 HGDP populations, and 49 individuals with whole-genome sequences from 10 populations. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) demonstrated extreme directional differentiation of risk allele frequencies across human populations, compared with null distributions of European-frequency matched control genomic alleles and risk alleles for other diseases. Most T2D risk alleles share a consistent pattern of decreasing frequencies along human migration into East Asia. Furthermore, we show that these patterns contribute to disparities in predicted genetic risk across 1,397 HapMap individuals, T2D genetic risk being consistently higher for individuals in the African populations and lower in the Asian populations, irrespective of the ethnicity considered in the initial discovery of risk alleles. We observed a similar pattern in the distribution of T2D Genetic Risk Scores, which are associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program cohort, for the same individuals. This disparity may be attributable to the promotion of energy storage and usage appropriate to environments and inconsistent energy intake. Our results indicate that the differential frequencies of T2D risk alleles may contribute to the observed disparity in T2D incidence rates across ethnic populations.},

@article{Zhang:2014fy,
	Abstract = {Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which altered immune function typically plays an important role in mediating the effect of environmental insults and regulation of inflammation. The breast cancer suppressor protein associated protein (BRAP) is suggested to exert vital effects in neurodevelopment by modulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and inflammation signaling. To explore the possible role of BRAP in SZ, we conducted a two-stage study to examine the association of BRAP polymorphisms with SZ in the Han Chinese population. In stage one, we screened SNPs in BRAP from our GWAS data, which detected three associated SNPs, with rs3782886 being the most significant one (P  =  2.31E-6, OR  =  0.67). In stage two, we validated these three SNPs in an independently collected population including 1957 patients and 1509 controls, supporting the association of rs3782886 with SZ (P  =  1.43E-6, OR  =  0.73). Furthermore, cis-eQTL analysis indicates that rs3782886 genotypes are associated with mRNA levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family (ALDH2) (P  =  0.0039) and myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MYL2) (P < 1.0E-4). Our data suggest that the BRAP gene may confer vulnerability for SZ in Han Chinese population, adding further evidence for the involvement of developmental and/or neuroinflammatory cascades in the illness.},

	Abstract = {Performing genetic studies in multiple human populations can identify disease risk alleles that are common in one population but rare in others, with the potential to illuminate pathophysiology, health disparities, and the population genetic origins of disease alleles. Here we analysed 9.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 8,214 Mexicans and other Latin Americans: 3,848 with type 2 diabetes and 4,366 non-diabetic controls. In addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P = 3.9 × 10(-13); odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and replicated in independent samples (P = 1.1 × 10(-4); OR = 1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at ~50% frequency in Native American samples and ~10% in east Asian, but is rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism.},

@article{Hsu:2013dp,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term environmental variables are widely understood to play important roles in DNA variation. Previously, clinical studies examining the impacts of these variables on the human genome were localized to a single country, and used preselected DNA variants. Furthermore, clinical studies or surveys are either not available or difficult to carry out for developing countries. A systematic approach utilizing bioinformatics to identify associations among environmental variables, genetic variation, and diseases across various geographical locations is needed but has been lacking.
METHODS: Using a novel Geographic-Wide Association Study (GeoWAS) methodology, we identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) with population allele frequencies associated geographical ultraviolet radiation exposure, and then assessed the diseases known to be assigned with these SNPs.
RESULTS: 2,857 radiation SNPs were identified from over 650,000 SNPs in 52 indigenous populations across the world. Using a quantitative disease-SNP database curated from 5,065 human genetic papers, we identified disease associations with those radiation SNPs. The correlation of the rs16891982 SNP in the SLC45A2 gene with melanoma was used as a case study for analysis of disease risk, and the results were consistent with the incidence and mortality rates of melanoma in published scientific literature. Finally, by analyzing the ontology of genes in which the radiation SNPs were significantly enriched, potential associations between SNPs and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease were hypothesized.
CONCLUSION: A systematic approach using GeoWAS has enabled us to identify DNA variation associated with ultraviolet radiation and their connections to diseases such as skin cancers. Our analyses have led to a better understating at the genetic level of why certain diseases are more predominant in specific geographical locations, due to the interactions between environmental variables such as ultraviolet radiation and the population types in those regions. The hypotheses proposed in GeoWAS can lead to future testing and interdisciplinary research.},

@article{Ko:2012kl,
	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies can identify common differences that contribute to human phenotypic diversity and disease. When genome-wide association studies are combined with approaches that test how variants alter physiology, biological insights can emerge. Here, we used such an approach to reveal regulation of cell death by the methionine salvage pathway. A common SNP associated with reduced expression of a putative methionine salvage pathway dehydratase, apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1)-interacting protein (APIP), was associated with increased caspase-1-mediated cell death in response to Salmonella. The role of APIP in methionine salvage was confirmed by growth assays with methionine-deficient media and quantitation of the methionine salvage substrate, 5'-methylthioadenosine. Reducing expression of APIP or exogenous addition of 5'-methylthioadenosine increased Salmonellae-induced cell death. Consistent with APIP originally being identified as an inhibitor of caspase-9-dependent apoptosis, the same allele was also associated with increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent carboplatin. Our results show that common human variation affecting expression of a single gene can alter susceptibility to two distinct cell death programs. Furthermore, the same allele that promotes cell death is associated with improved survival of individuals with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, suggesting a possible evolutionary pressure that may explain the geographic pattern observed for the frequency of this SNP. Our study shows that in vitro association screens of disease-related traits can not only reveal human genetic differences that contribute to disease but also provide unexpected insights into cell biology.},

We propose a new approach, spatial ancestry analysis, for the modeling of genotypes in two- or three-dimensional space. In spatial ancestry analysis (SPA), we explicitly model the spatial distribution of each SNP by assigning an allele frequency as a continuous function in geographic space. We show that the explicit modeling of the allele frequency allows individuals to be localized on the map on the basis of their genetic information alone. We apply our SPA method to a European and a worldwide population genetic variation data set and identify SNPs showing large gradients in allele frequency, and we suggest these as candidate regions under selection. These regions include SNPs in the well-characterized LCT region, as well as at loci including FOXP2, OCA2 and LRP1B.},

	Abstract = {Structure, is a widely used software tool to investigate population genetic structure with multi-locus genotyping data. The software uses an iterative algorithm to group individuals into "K" clusters, representing possibly K genetically distinct subpopulations. The serial implementation of this programme is processor-intensive even with small datasets. We describe an implementation of the program within a parallel framework. Speedup was achieved by running different replicates and values of K on each node of the cluster. A web-based user-oriented GUI has been implemented in PHP, through which the user can specify input parameters for the programme. The number of processors to be used can be specified in the background command. A web-based visualization tool "Visualstruct", written in PHP (HTML and Java script embedded), allows for the graphical display of population clusters output from Structure, where each individual may be visualized as a line segment with K colors defining its possible genomic composition with respect to the K genetic sub-populations. The advantage over available programs is in the increased number of individuals that can be visualized. The analyses of real datasets indicate a speedup of up to four, when comparing the speed of execution on clusters of eight processors with the speed of execution on one desktop. The software package is freely available to interested users upon request.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering of individuals into populations on the basis of multilocus genotypes is informative in a variety of settings. In population-genetic clustering algorithms, such as BAPS, STRUCTURE and TESS, individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a set of clusters, often using unsupervised approaches that involve stochastic simulation. As a result, replicate cluster analyses of the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated cluster membership coefficients, even though the same initial conditions were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two main sources: (1) 'label switching' of clusters across replicates, caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised analysis are labeled, and (2) 'genuine multimodality,' truly distinct solutions across replicates.
RESULTS: To facilitate the interpretation of population-genetic clustering results, we describe three algorithms for aligning multiple replicate analyses of the same data set. We have implemented these algorithms in the computer program CLUMPP (CLUster Matching and Permutation Program). We illustrate the use of CLUMPP by aligning the cluster membership coefficients from 100 replicate cluster analyses of 600 chickens from 20 different breeds.

	Abstract = {Objectives: We present an up-to-date review of STRUCTURE software: one of the most widely used population analysis tools that allows researchers to assess patterns of genetic structure in a set of samples. STRUCTURE can identify subsets of the whole sample by detecting allele frequency differences within the data and can assign individuals to those sub-populations based on analysis of likelihoods. The review covers STRUCTURE's most commonly used ancestry and frequency models, plus an overview of the main applications of the software in human genetics including case-control association studies (CCAS), population genetics, and forensic analysis. The review is accompanied by supplementary material providing a step-by-step guide to running STRUCTURE. Methods: With reference to a worked example, we explore the effects of changing the principal analysis parameters on STRUCTURE results when analyzing a uniform set of human genetic data. Use of the supporting software: CLUMPP and distruct is detailed and we provide an overview and worked example of STRAT software, applicable to CCAS. Conclusion: The guide offers a simplified view of how STRUCTURE, CLUMPP, distruct, and STRAT can be applied to provide researchers with an informed choice of parameter settings and supporting software when analyzing their own genetic data.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary pressures due to variation in climate play an important role in shaping phenotypic variation among and within species and have been shown to influence variation in phenotypes such as body shape and size among humans. Genes involved in energy metabolism are likely to be central to heat and cold tolerance. To test the hypothesis that climate shaped variation in metabolism genes in humans, we used a bioinformatics approach based on network theory to select 82 candidate genes for common metabolic disorders. We genotyped 873 tag SNPs in these genes in 54 worldwide populations (including the 52 in the Human Genome Diversity Project panel) and found correlations with climate variables using rank correlation analysis and a newly developed method termed Bayesian geographic analysis. In addition, we genotyped 210 carefully matched control SNPs to provide an empirical null distribution for spatial patterns of allele frequency due to population history alone. For nearly all climate variables, we found an excess of genic SNPs in the tail of the distributions of the test statistics compared to the control SNPs, implying that metabolic genes as a group show signals of spatially varying selection. Among our strongest signals were several SNPs (e.g., LEPR R109K, FABP2 A54T) that had previously been associated with phenotypes directly related to cold tolerance. Since variation in climate may be correlated with other aspects of environmental variation, it is possible that some of the signals that we detected reflect selective pressures other than climate. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the idea that climate has been an important selective pressure acting on candidate genes for common metabolic disorders.},

	Abstract = {Human populations use a variety of subsistence strategies to exploit an exceptionally broad range of ecoregions and dietary components. These aspects of human environments have changed dramatically during human evolution, giving rise to new selective pressures. To understand the genetic basis of human adaptations, we combine population genetics data with ecological information to detect variants that increased in frequency in response to new selective pressures. Our approach detects SNPs that show concordant differences in allele frequencies across populations with respect to specific aspects of the environment. Genic and especially nonsynonymous SNPs are overrepresented among those most strongly correlated with environmental variables. This provides genome-wide evidence for selection due to changes in ecoregion, diet, and subsistence. We find particularly strong signals associated with polar ecoregions, with foraging, and with a diet rich in roots and tubers. Interestingly, several of the strongest signals overlap with those implicated in energy metabolism phenotypes from genome-wide association studies, including SNPs influencing glucose levels and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, several pathways, including those of starch and sucrose metabolism, are enriched for strong signals of adaptations to a diet rich in roots and tubers, whereas signals associated with polar ecoregions are overrepresented in genes associated with energy metabolism pathways.},

	Abstract = {Humans show tremendous phenotypic diversity across geographically distributed populations, and much of this diversity undoubtedly results from genetic adaptations to different environmental pressures. The availability of genome-wide genetic variation data from densely sampled populations offers unprecedented opportunities for identifying the loci responsible for these adaptations and for elucidating the genetic architecture of human adaptive traits. Several approaches have been used to detect signals of selection in human populations, and these approaches differ in the assumptions they make about the underlying mode of selection. We contrast the results of approaches based on haplotype structure and differentiation of allele frequencies to those from a method for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms strongly correlated with environmental variables. Although the first group of approaches tends to detect new beneficial alleles that were driven to high frequencies by selection, the environmental correlation approach has power to identify alleles that experienced small shifts in frequency owing to selection. We suggest that the first group of approaches tends to identify only variants with relatively strong phenotypic effects, whereas the environmental correlation methods can detect variants that make smaller contributions to an adaptive trait.},

	Abstract = {Production of heat via nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) is critical for temperature homeostasis in mammals. Uncoupling protein UCP1 plays a central role in NST by uncoupling the proton gradients produced in the inner membranes of mitochondria to produce heat; however, the extent to which UCP1 homologues, UCP2 and UCP3, are involved in NST is the subject of an ongoing debate. We used an evolutionary approach to test the hypotheses that variants that are associated with increased expression of these genes (UCP1 -3826A, UCP2 -866A, and UCP3 -55T) show evidence of adaptation with winter climate. To that end, we calculated correlations between allele frequencies and winter climate variables for these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which we genotyped in a panel of 52 worldwide populations. We found significant correlations with winter climate for UCP1 -3826G/A and UCP3 -55C/T. Further, by analyzing previously published genotype data for these SNPs, we found that the peak of the correlation for the UCP1 region occurred at the disease-associated -3826A/G variant and that the UCP3 region has a striking signal overall, with several individual SNPs showing interesting patterns, including the -55C/T variant. Resequencing of the regions in a set of three diverse population samples helped to clarify the signals that we found with the genotype data. At UCP1, the resequencing data revealed modest evidence that the haplotype carrying the -3826A variant was driven to high frequency by selection. In the UCP3 region, combining results from the climate analysis and resequencing survey suggest a more complex model in which variants on multiple haplotypes may independently be correlated with temperature. This is further supported by an excess of intermediate frequency variants in the UCP3 region in the Han Chinese population. Taken together, our results suggest that adaptation to climate influenced the global distribution of allele frequencies in UCP1 and UCP3 and provide an independent source of evidence for a role in cold resistance for UCP3.},

@article{Maher:2012sp,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Identifying drivers of complex traits from the noisy signals of genetic variation obtained from high-throughput genome sequencing technologies is a central challenge faced by human geneticists today. We hypothesize that the variants involved in complex diseases are likely to exhibit non-neutral evolutionary signatures. Uncovering the evolutionary history of all variants is therefore of intrinsic interest for complex disease research. However, doing so necessitates the simultaneous elucidation of the targets of natural selection and population-specific demographic history.
METHODS: Here we characterize the action of natural selection operating across complex disease categories, and use population genetic simulations to evaluate the expected patterns of genetic variation in large samples. We focus on populations that have experienced historical bottlenecks followed by explosive growth (consistent with many human populations), and describe the differences between evolutionarily deleterious mutations and those that are neutral.
RESULTS: Genes associated with several complex disease categories exhibit stronger signatures of purifying selection than non-disease genes. In addition, loci identified through genome-wide association studies of complex traits also exhibit signatures consistent with being in regions recurrently targeted by purifying selection. Through simulations, we show that population bottlenecks and rapid growth enable deleterious rare variants to persist at low frequencies just as long as neutral variants, but low-frequency and common variants tend to be much younger than neutral variants. This has resulted in a large proportion of modern-day rare alleles that have a deleterious effect on function and that potentially contribute to disease susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: The key question for sequencing-based association studies of complex traits is how to distinguish between deleterious and benign genetic variation. We used population genetic simulations to uncover patterns of genetic variation that distinguish these two categories, especially derived allele age, thereby providing inroads into novel methods for characterizing rare genetic variation driving complex diseases.},

	Url = {http://www.genetics.org/content/186/1/207.abstract N2 - Next generation sequencing (NGS) is about to revolutionize genetic analysis. Currently NGS techniques are mainly used to sequence individual genomes. Due to the high sequence coverage required, the costs for population-scale analyses are still too high to allow an extension to nonmodel organisms. Here, we show that NGS of pools of individuals is often more effective in SNP discovery and provides more accurate allele frequency estimates, even when taking sequencing errors into account. We modify the population genetic estimators Tajima's π and Watterson's θ to obtain unbiased estimates from NGS pooling data. Given the same sequencing effort, the resulting estimators often show a better performance than those obtained from individual sequencing. Although our analysis also shows that NGS of pools of individuals will not be preferable under all circumstances, it provides a cost-effective approach to estimate allele frequencies on a genome-wide scale.},

	Abstract = {Summary: Sequencing pooled DNA samples (Pool-Seq) is the most cost-effective approach for the genome-wide comparison of population samples. Here, we introduce PoPoolation2, the first software tool specifically designed for the comparison of populations with Pool-Seq data. PoPoolation2 implements a range of commonly used measures of differentiation (FST, Fisher's exact test and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) that can be applied on different scales (windows, genes, exons, SNPs). The result may be visualized with the widely used Integrated Genomics Viewer.Availability and implementation: PoPoolation2 is implemented in Perl and R.

                   studies have proven to be effective tools for
                   identifying parts of the genome that influence disease
                   risk and other heritable traits. So-called "genotype
                   imputation" methods form a cornerstone of modern
                   association studies: by extrapolating genetic
                   correlations from a densely characterized reference
                   panel to a sparsely typed study sample, such methods
                   can estimate unobserved genotypes with high accuracy,
                   thereby increasing the chances of finding true
                   associations. To date, most genome-wide imputation
                   analyses have used reference data from the
                   International HapMap Project. While this strategy has
                   been successful, association studies in the near future
                   will also have access to additional reference
                   information, such as control sets genotyped on multiple
                   SNP chips and dense genome-wide haplotypes from the
                   1,000 Genomes Project. These new reference panels
                   should improve the quality and scope of imputation, but
                   they also present new methodological challenges. We
                   describe a genotype imputation method, IMPUTE version
                   2, that is designed to address these challenges in
                   next-generation association studies. We show that our
                   method can use a reference panel containing thousands
                   of chromosomes to attain higher accuracy than is
                   possible with the HapMap alone, and that our approach
                   is more accurate than competing methods on both current
                   and next-generation datasets. We also highlight the
                   modeling issues that arise in imputation datasets.</p> },

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic maps provide specific positions of
                   genetic markers, which are required for performing
                   genetic studies. Linkage analyses of Asian families
                   have been performed with Caucasian genetic maps, since
                   appropriate genetic maps of Asians were not available.
                   Different ethnic groups may have different
                   recombination rates as a result of genomic variations,
                   which would generate misspecification of the genetic
                   map and reduce the power of linkage analyses. RESULTS:
                   We constructed the genetic map of a Mongolian
                   population in Asia with CRIMAP software. This new map,
                   called the GENDISCAN map, is based on genotype data
                   collected from 1026 individuals of 73 large Mongolian
                   families, and includes 1790 total and 1500 observable
                   meioses. The GENDISCAN map provides sex-averaged and
                   sex-specific genetic positions of 1039 microsatellite
                   markers in Kosambi centimorgans (cM) with physical
                   positions. We also determined 95\% confidence intervals
                   of genetic distances of the adjacent marker intervals.
                   Genetic lengths of the whole genome, chromosomes and
                   adjacent marker intervals are compared with those of
                   Rutgers Map v.2, which was constructed based on
                   Caucasian populations (Centre d'Etudes du Polymorphisme
                   Humain (CEPH) and Icelandic families) by mapping
                   methods identical to those of the GENDISCAN map, CRIMAP
                   software and the Kosambi map function. Mongolians
                   showed approximately 1.9 fewer recombinations per
                   meiosis than Caucasians. As a result, genetic lengths
                   of the whole genome and chromosomes of the GENDISCAN
                   map are shorter than those of Rutgers Map v.2.
                   Thirty-eight marker intervals differed significantly
                   between the Mongolian and Caucasian genetic maps.
                   CONCLUSION: The new GENDISCAN map is applicable to the
                   genetic study of Asian populations. Differences in the
                   genetic distances between the GENDISCAN and Caucasian
                   maps could facilitate elucidation of genomic variations
                   between different ethnic groups.},

                   factors. Of the limited genetic studies performed on
                   populations of African descent, notable differences in
                   susceptibility allele frequencies have been observed.
                   OBJECTIVES: We sought to test the hypothesis that some
                   genes might contribute to the profound disparities in
                   asthma. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association
                   study in 2 independent populations of African ancestry
                   (935 African American asthmatic cases and control
                   subjects from the Baltimore-Washington, DC, area and
                   929 African Caribbean asthmatic subjects and their
                   family members from Barbados) to identify
                   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with
                   asthma. RESULTS: A meta-analysis combining these 2
                   African-ancestry populations yielded 3 SNPs with a
                   combined P value of less than 10(-5) in genes of
                   potential biologic relevance to asthma and allergic
                   disease: rs10515807, mapping to the alpha-1B-adrenergic
                   receptor (ADRA1B) gene on chromosome 5q33 (3.57 x
                   10(-6)); rs6052761, mapping to the prion-related
                   protein (PRNP) gene on chromosome 20pter-p12 (2.27 x
                   10(-6)); and rs1435879, mapping to the dipeptidyl
                   peptidase 10 (DPP10) gene on chromosome 2q12.3-q14.2.
                   The generalizability of these findings was tested in
                   family and case-control panels of United Kingdom and
                   German origin, respectively, but none of the
                   associations observed in the African groups were
                   replicated in these European studies. Evidence for
                   association was also examined in 4 additional
                   case-control studies of African Americans; however,
                   none of the SNPs implicated in the discovery population
                   were replicated. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates
                   the complexity of identifying true associations for a
                   complex and heterogeneous disease, such as asthma, in
                   admixed populations, especially populations of African
                   descent.},

                   geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35\%
                   of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed.
                   The map is estimated to capture untyped common
                   variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and
                   0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the
                   current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping
                   products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average
                   maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in

                   interest in the use of ancestry informative markers
                   (AIMs) to deconstruct racial categories into useful
                   variables. Studies on recently admixed populations have
                   shown significant population substructure due to
                   differences in individual ancestry; however, few
                   studies have examined Caribbean populations. Here we
                   used a panel of 28 AIMs to examine the genetic ancestry
                   of 298 individuals of African descent from the
                   Caribbean islands of Jamaica, St. Thomas and Barbados.
                   Differences in global admixture were observed, with
                   Barbados having the highest level of West African
                   ancestry (89.6\%+/- 2.0) and the lowest levels of
                   European (10.2\%+/- 2.2) and Native American ancestry
                   (0.2\%+/- 2.0), while Jamaica possessed the highest
                   levels of European (12.4\%+/- 3.5) and Native American
                   ancestry (3.2\%+/- 3.1). St. Thomas, USVI had ancestry
                   levels quite similar to African Americans in
                   continental U.S. (86.8\%+/- 2.2 West African, 10.6\%+/-
                   2.3 European, and 2.6\%+/- 2.1 Native American).
                   Significant substructure was observed in the islands of
                   Jamaica and St. Thomas but not Barbados (K=1),
                   indicating that differences in population substructure
                   exist across these three Caribbean islands. These
                   differences likely stem from diverse colonial and
                   historical experiences, and subsequent evolutionary
                   processes. Most importantly, these differences may have
                   significant ramifications for case-control studies of

                   and the Caribbean share similar historical backgrounds
                   but the distributions of African admixture may differ.
                   We selected 416 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) to
                   estimate and compare admixture proportions using
                   STRUCTURE in 906 unrelated African Americans (AAs) and
                   294 Barbadians (ACs) from a study of asthma. This
                   analysis showed AAs on average were 72.5\% African,
                   19.6\% European and 8\% Asian, while ACs were 77.4\%
                   African, 15.9\% European, and 6.7\% Asian which were
                   significantly different. A principal components
                   analysis based on these AIMs yielded one primary
                   eigenvector that explained 54.04\% of the variation and
                   captured a gradient from West African to European
                   admixture. This principal component was highly
                   correlated with African vs. European ancestry as
                   estimated by STRUCTURE (r(2)=0.992, r(2)=0.912,
                   respectively). To investigate other African
                   contributions to African American and Barbadian
                   admixture, we performed PCA on approximately 14,000
                   (14k) genome-wide SNPs in AAs, ACs, Yorubans, Luhya and
                   Maasai African groups, and estimated genetic distances
                   (F(ST)). We found AAs and ACs were closest genetically
                   (F(ST)=0.008), and both were closer to the Yorubans
                   than the other East African populations. In our sample
                   of individuals of African descent, approximately 400
                   well-defined AIMs were just as good for detecting

                   pathogenesis. Here, we describe the refined genetic
                   structure of a 3.8-Mb inversion polymorphism at
                   chromosome 8p23. Using HapMap data of 1,073 SNPs
                   generated from 209 unrelated samples from CEPH-Utah
                   residents with ancestry from northern and western
                   Europe (CEU); Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); and
                   Asian (ASN) samples, which were comprised of Han
                   Chinese from Beijing, China (CHB) and Japanese from
                   Tokyo, Japan (JPT)-we successfully deduced the
                   inversion orientations of all their 418 haplotypes. In
                   particular, distinct haplotype subgroups were
                   identified based on principal component analysis (PCA).
                   Such genetic substructures were consistent with
                   clustering patterns based on neighbor-joining tree
                   reconstruction, which revealed a total of four
                   haplotype clades across all samples. Metaphase
                   fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a subset
                   of 10 HapMap samples verified their inversion
                   orientations predicted by PCA or phylogenetic tree
                   reconstruction. Positioning of the outgroup haplotype
                   within one of YRI clades suggested that Human NCBI
                   Build 36-inverted order is most likely the ancestral
                   orientation. Furthermore, the population
                   differentiation test and the relative extended
                   haplotype homozygosity (REHH) analysis in this region
                   discovered multiple selection signals, also in a
                   population-specific manner. A positive selection signal
                   was detected at XKR6 in the ASN population. These
                   results revealed the correlation of inversion
                   polymorphisms to population-specific genetic
                   structures, and various selection patterns as possible
                   mechanisms for the maintenance of a large chromosomal
                   rearrangement at 8p23 region during evolution. In
                   addition, our study also showed that haplotype-based
                   clustering methods, such as PCA, can be applied in
                   scanning for cryptic inversion polymorphisms at a
                   genome-wide scale.},

                   Family-based sequencing allowed us to delineate
                   recombination sites precisely, identify 70\% of the
                   sequencing errors (resulting in > 99.999\% accuracy),
                   and identify very rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
                   We also directly estimated a human intergeneration
                   mutation rate of approximately 1.1 x 10(-8) per
                   position per haploid genome. Both offspring in this
                   family have two recessive disorders: Miller syndrome,
                   for which the gene was concurrently identified, and
                   primary ciliary dyskinesia, for which causative genes
                   have been previously identified. Family-based genome

                   individuals is far from complete, and owing to the
                   resolution of detection systems used, the majority of
                   loci reported so far are relatively large (
                   approximately 65\%>10 kb). Applying a two-stage
                   high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
                   approach to analyse 50 healthy Caucasian males from
                   northern France, we discovered 2208 copy number
                   variants (CNVs) detected by more than one consecutive
                   probe. These clustered into 1469 CNV regions (CNVRs),
                   of which 721 are thought to be novel. The majority of
                   these are small (median size 4.4 kb) and most have
                   common boundaries, with a coefficient of variation less
                   than 0.1 for 83\% of endpoints in those observed in
                   multiple samples. Only 6\% of the CNVRs analysed showed
                   evidence of both copy number losses and gains at the
                   same site. A further 6089 variants were detected by
                   single probes: 48\% of these were observed in more than
                   one individual. In total, 2570 genes were seen to
                   intersect variants: 1284 in novel loci. Genes involved
                   in differentiation and development were significantly
                   over-represented and approximately half of the genes
                   identified feature in the Online Mendelian Inheritance

                   genes affected, along with the well-conserved nature of
                   the majority of the CNVs, suggests that they could have
                   important implications for phenotype and, thus, be

	Abstract = {Although recombination is essential to the successful
                   completion of human meiosis, it remains unclear how
                   tightly the process is regulated and over what scale.
                   To assess the nature and stringency of constraints on
                   human recombination, we examined crossover patterns in
                   transmissions to viable, non-trisomic offspring, using
                   dense genotyping data collected in a large set of
                   pedigrees. Our analysis supports a requirement for one
                   chiasma per chromosome rather than per arm to ensure
                   proper disjunction, with additional chiasmata occurring
                   in proportion to physical length. The requirement is
                   not absolute, however, as chromosome 21 seems to be
                   frequently transmitted properly in the absence of a
                   chiasma in females, a finding that raises the
                   possibility of a back-up mechanism aiding in its
                   correct segregation. We also found a set of double
                   crossovers in surprisingly close proximity, as expected
                   from a second pathway that is not subject to crossover
                   interference. These findings point to multiple
                   mechanisms that shape the distribution of crossovers,

	Abstract = {Population genetic models play an important role in
                   human genetic research, connecting empirical
                   observations about sequence variation with hypotheses
                   about underlying historical and biological causes. More
                   specifically, models are used to compare empirical
                   measures of sequence variation, linkage disequilibrium
                   (LD), and selection to expectations under a "null"
                   distribution. In the absence of detailed information
                   about human demographic history, and about variation in
                   mutation and recombination rates, simulations have of
                   necessity used arbitrary models, usually simple ones.
                   With the advent of large empirical data sets, it is now
                   possible to calibrate population genetic models with
                   genome-wide data, permitting for the first time the
                   generation of data that are consistent with empirical
                   data across a wide range of characteristics. We present
                   here the first such calibrated model and show that,
                   while still arbitrary, it successfully generates
                   simulated data (for three populations) that closely
                   resemble empirical data in allele frequency, linkage
                   disequilibrium, and population differentiation. No
                   assertion is made about the accuracy of the proposed
                   historical and recombination model, but its ability to
                   generate realistic data meets a long-standing need
                   among geneticists. We anticipate that this model, for
                   which software is publicly available, and others like
                   it will have numerous applications in empirical studies
                   of human genetics.},

	Abstract = {The human genome is a highly dynamic structure that
                   shows a wide range of genetic polymorphic variation.
                   Unlike other types of structural variation, little is
                   known about inversion variants within normal
                   individuals because such events are typically balanced
                   and are difficult to detect and analyze by standard
                   molecular approaches. Using sequence-based, cytogenetic
                   and genotyping approaches, we characterized six large
                   inversion polymorphisms that map to regions associated
                   with genomic disorders with complex segmental
                   duplications mapping at the breakpoints. We developed a
                   metaphase FISH-based assay to genotype inversions and
                   analyzed the chromosomes of 27 individuals from three
                   HapMap populations. In this subset, we find that these
                   inversions are less frequent or absent in Asians when
                   compared with European and Yoruban populations.
                   Analyzing multiple individuals from outgroup species of
                   great apes, we show that most of these large inversion
                   polymorphisms are specific to the human lineage with
                   two exceptions, 17q21.31 and 8p23 inversions, which are
                   found to be similarly polymorphic in other great ape
                   species and where the inverted allele represents the
                   ancestral state. Investigating linkage disequilibrium
                   relationships with genotyped SNPs, we provide evidence
                   that most of these inversions appear to have arisen on
                   at least two different haplotype backgrounds. In these
                   cases, discovery and genotyping methods based on SNPs
                   may be confounded and molecular cytogenetics remains
                   the only method to genotype these inversions.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe asthma causes the majority of
                   asthma morbidity. Understanding mechanisms that
                   contribute to the development of severe disease is
                   important. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the Severe Asthma
                   Research Program is to identify and characterize
                   subjects with severe asthma to understand
                   pathophysiologic mechanisms in severe asthma. METHODS:
                   We performed a comprehensive phenotypic
                   characterization (questionnaires, atopy and pulmonary
                   function testing, phlebotomy, exhaled nitric oxide) in
                   subjects with severe and not severe asthma. RESULTS: A
                   total of 438 subjects with asthma were studied (204
                   severe, 70 moderate, 164 mild). Severe subjects with
                   asthma were older with longer disease duration (P <
                   .0001), more daily symptoms, intense urgent health care
                   utilization, sinusitis, and pneumonia (P < or = .0001).
                   Lung function was lower in severe asthma with marked
                   bronchodilator reversibility (P < .001). The severe
                   group had less atopy by skin tests (P = .0007), but
                   blood eosinophils, IgE, and exhaled nitric oxide levels
                   did not differentiate disease severity. A reduced
                   FEV(1), history of pneumonia, and fewer positive skin
                   tests were risk factors for severe disease. Early
                   disease onset (age < 12 years) in severe asthma was
                   associated with longer disease duration (P < .0001) and
                   more urgent health care, especially intensive care (P =
                   .002). Later disease onset (age > or = 12 years) was
                   associated with lower lung function and sinopulmonary
                   infections (P < or = .02). CONCLUSION: Severe asthma is
                   characterized by abnormal lung function that is
                   responsive to bronchodilators, a history of
                   sinopulmonary infections, persistent symptoms, and
                   increased health care utilization. CLINICAL
                   IMPLICATIONS: Lung function abnormalities in severe
                   asthma are reversible in most patients, and pneumonia
                   is a risk factor for the development of severe disease.},

	Abstract = {Hispanic/Latino populations possess a complex genetic
                   structure that reflects recent admixture among and
                   potentially ancient substructure within Native
                   American, European, and West African source
                   populations. Here, we quantify genome-wide patterns of
                   SNP and haplotype variation among 100 individuals with
                   ancestry from Ecuador, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and the
                   Dominican Republic genotyped on the Illumina 610-Quad
                   arrays and 112 Mexicans genotyped on Affymetrix 500K
                   platform. Intersecting these data with previously
                   collected high-density SNP data from 4,305 individuals,
                   we use principal component analysis and clustering
                   methods FRAPPE and STRUCTURE to investigate genome-wide
                   patterns of African, European, and Native American
                   population structure within and among Hispanic/Latino
                   populations. Comparing autosomal, X and Y chromosome,
                   and mtDNA variation, we find evidence of a significant
                   sex bias in admixture proportions consistent with
                   disproportionate contribution of European male and
                   Native American female ancestry to present-day
                   populations. We also find that patterns of
                   linkage-disequilibria in admixed Hispanic/Latino
                   populations are largely affected by the admixture
                   dynamics of the populations, with faster decay of LD in
                   populations of higher African ancestry. Finally, using
                   the locus-specific ancestry inference method LAMP, we
                   reconstruct fine-scale chromosomal patterns of
                   admixture. We document moderate power to differentiate
                   among potential subcontinental source populations
                   within the Native American, European, and African
                   segments of the admixed Hispanic/Latino genomes. Our
                   results suggest future genome-wide association scans in
                   Hispanic/Latino populations may require correction for
                   local genomic ancestry at a subcontinental scale when
                   associating differences in the genome with disease
                   risk, progression, and drug efficacy, as well as for

	Abstract = { There has been considerable excitement over the
                   ability to construct linkage maps based only on
                   genome-wide genotype data for single nucleotide
                   polymorphic sites (SNPs) in a population sample. These
                   maps, which are derived from estimates of linkage
                   disequilibrium (LD), rely on population genetics theory
                   to relate the decay of LD to the local rate of
                   recombination, but other population processes also come
                   into play. Here we contrast these LD maps to the
                   classically derived, pedigree-based human recombination
                   maps. The LD maps have a level of resolution greatly
                   exceeding that of the pedigree maps, and at this fine
                   scale, sperm typing allows a means of validation. While
                   at a gross level both the pedigree maps and the sperm
                   typing methods generally agree with LD maps, there are
                   significant local differences between them, and the
                   fact that these maps measure different genetic features
                   should be remembered when using them for other genetic
                   inferences. },

	Abstract = {With a draft genome-sequence assembly for the
                   chimpanzee available, it is now possible to perform
                   genome-wide analyses to identify, at a submicroscopic
                   level, structural rearrangements that have occurred
                   between chimpanzees and humans. The goal of this study
                   was to investigate chromosomal regions that are
                   inverted between the chimpanzee and human genomes.
                   Using the net alignments for the builds of the human
                   and chimpanzee genome assemblies, we identified a total
                   of 1,576 putative regions of inverted orientation,
                   covering more than 154 mega-bases of DNA. The DNA
                   segments are distributed throughout the genome and
                   range from 23 base pairs to 62 mega-bases in length.
                   For the 66 inversions more than 25 kilobases (kb) in
                   length, 75\% were flanked on one or both sides by
                   (often unrelated) segmental duplications. Using PCR and
                   fluorescence in situ hybridization we experimentally
                   validated 23 of 27 (85\%) semi-randomly chosen regions;
                   the largest novel inversion confirmed was 4.3
                   mega-bases at human Chromosome 7p14. Gorilla was used
                   as an out-group to assign ancestral status to the
                   variants. All experimentally validated inversion
                   regions were then assayed against a panel of human
                   samples and three of the 23 (13\%) regions were found
                   to be polymorphic in the human genome. These
                   polymorphic inversions include 730 kb (at 7p22), 13 kb
                   (at 7q11), and 1 kb (at 16q24) fragments with a 5\%,
                   30\%, and 48\% minor allele frequency, respectively.
                   Our results suggest that inversions are an important
                   source of variation in primate genome evolution. The
                   finding of at least three novel inversion polymorphisms
                   in humans indicates this type of structural variation
                   may be a more common feature of our genome than
                   previously realized.},

                   location between the species. We report that a 13-base

                   populations of African descent in the United States
                   (Maywood, Illinois; Detroit; New York; Philadelphia;
                   Pittsburgh; Baltimore; Charleston, South Carolina; New
                   Orleans; and Houston) and in Jamaica, using nine
                   autosomal DNA markers. These markers either are
                   population-specific or show frequency differences >45\%
                   between the parental populations and are thus
                   especially informative for admixture. European genetic
                   ancestry ranged from 6.8\% (Jamaica) to 22.5\% (New
                   Orleans). The unique utility of these markers is
                   reflected in the low variance associated with these
                   admixture estimates (SEM 1.3\%-2.7\%). We also
                   estimated the male and female European contribution to
                   African Americans, on the basis of informative mtDNA
                   (haplogroups H and L) and Y Alu polymorphic markers.
                   Results indicate a sex-biased gene flow from Europeans,
                   the male contribution being substantially greater than
                   the female contribution. mtDNA haplogroups analysis
                   shows no evidence of a significant maternal Amerindian
                   contribution to any of the 10 populations. We detected
                   significant nonrandom association between two markers
                   located 22 cM apart (FY-null and AT3), most likely due
                   to admixture linkage disequilibrium created in the
                   interbreeding of the two parental populations. The
                   strength of this association and the substantial
                   genetic distance between FY and AT3 emphasize the
                   importance of admixed populations as a useful resource

	Abstract = {Human genetic linkage maps are based on rates of
                   recombination across the genome. These rates in humans
                   vary by the sex of the parent from whom alleles are
                   inherited, by chromosomal position, and by genomic
                   features, such as GC content and repeat density. We
                   have examined--for the first time, to our
                   knowledge--racial/ethnic differences in genetic maps of
                   humans. We constructed genetic maps based on 353
                   microsatellite markers in four racial/ethnic groups:
                   whites, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and East
                   Asians (Chinese and Japanese). These maps were
                   generated using 9,291 subjects from 2,900 nuclear
                   families who participated in the National Heart, Lung,
                   and Blood Institute-funded Family Blood Pressure
                   Program, the largest sample used for map construction
                   to date. Although the maps for the different groups are
                   generally similar, we did find regional and genomewide
                   differences across ethnic groups, including a longer
                   genomewide map for African Americans than for other
                   populations. Some of this variation was explained by
                   genotyping artifacts--namely, null alleles (i.e.,
                   alleles with null phenotypes) at a number of loci--and
                   by ethnic differences in null-allele frequencies. In
                   particular, null alleles appear to be the likely
                   explanation for the excess map length in African
                   Americans. We also found that nonrandom missing data
                   biases map results. However, we found regions on
                   chromosome 8p and telomeric segments with significant
                   ethnic differences and a suggestive interval on
                   chromosome 12q that were not due to genotype artifacts.
                   The difference on chromosome 8p is likely due to a
                   polymorphic inversion in the region. The results of our
                   investigation have implications for inferences of
                   possible genetic influences on human recombination as
                   well as for future linkage studies, especially those
                   involving populations of nonwhite ethnicity.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both a functional promoter polymorphism in
                   the gene encoding CD14 (C-260T) and exposure to
                   endotoxin are believed to play key roles in modulating
                   the immune response and expression of atopic disease.
                   OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the role of the CD14
                   C-260T polymorphism in a population of African descent
                   and to test for interaction between this genotype and
                   house dust endotoxin (HDE) exposure on atopic
                   phenotypes. METHODS: Asthmatic probands and their
                   families were recruited as part of the Barbados Asthma
                   Genetics Study. The C-260T polymorphism and two
                   additional CD14 promoter markers (G-1461T, C-1721T)
                   were genotyped. Endotoxin was measured in house dust
                   samples. RESULTS: Using a Family-Based Association
                   Test, the C-260T allele appeared to be protective
                   against asthma ( z = -2.444; P = .015) and asthma
                   severity ( z = -2.615; P = .009) under a recessive
                   model. No significant associations were observed for
                   the G-1461T and C-1721T markers both individually and
                   in haplotypes. In a case-control analysis, the CD14 TT
                   genotype was found to reduce risk of asthma compared
                   with the CD14 CC/CT genotypes (odds ratio [OR], 0.26;
                   95\% CI, 0.14-0.49) and was associated with lower
                   asthma severity scores ( P < .002). The TT genotype
                   might protect against asthma for individuals with low

	Abstract = {Knowledge about structural variation in the human
                   genome has grown tremendously in the past few years.
                   However, inversions represent a class of structural
                   variation that remains difficult to detect. We present
                   a statistical method to identify large inversion
                   polymorphisms using unusual Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
                   patterns from high-density SNP data. The method is
                   designed to detect chromosomal segments that are
                   inverted (in a majority of the chromosomes) in a
                   population with respect to the reference human genome
                   sequence. We demonstrate the power of this method to
                   detect such inversion polymorphisms through simulations
                   done using the HapMap data. Application of this method
                   to the data from the first phase of the International
                   HapMap project resulted in 176 candidate inversions
                   ranging from 200 kb to several megabases in length. Our
                   predicted inversions include an 800-kb polymorphic
                   inversion at 7p22, a 1.1-Mb inversion at 16p12, and a
                   novel 1.2-Mb inversion on chromosome 10 that is
                   supported by the presence of two discordant fosmids.
                   Analysis of the genomic sequence around inversion
                   breakpoints showed that 11 predicted inversions are
                   flanked by pairs of highly homologous repeats in the
                   inverted orientation. In addition, for three candidate
                   inversions, the inverted orientation is represented in
                   the Celera genome assembly. Although the power of our
                   method to detect inversions is restricted because of
                   inherently noisy LD patterns in population data,
                   inversions predicted by our method represent strong
                   candidates for experimental validation and analysis.},

@article{Kong2010,
	Abstract = {Meiotic recombinations contribute to genetic diversity
                   by yielding new combinations of alleles. Recently,
                   high-resolution recombination maps were inferred from
                   high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
                   using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns that capture
                   historical recombination events. The use of these maps
                   has been demonstrated by the identification of
                   recombination hotspots and associated motifs, and the
                   discovery that the PRDM9 gene affects the proportion of
                   recombinations occurring at hotspots. However, these
                   maps provide no information about individual or sex
                   differences. Moreover, locus-specific demographic
                   factors like natural selection can bias LD-based
                   estimates of recombination rate. Existing genetic maps
                   based on family data avoid these shortcomings, but
                   their resolution is limited by relatively few meioses
                   and a low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide
                   SNP data from 15,257 parent-offspring pairs to
                   construct the first recombination maps based on
                   directly observed recombinations with a resolution that
                   is effective down to 10 kilobases (kb). Comparing male
                   and female maps reveals that about 15\% of hotspots in
                   one sex are specific to that sex. Although male
                   recombinations result in more shuffling of exons within
                   genes, female recombinations generate more new
                   combinations of nearby genes. We discover novel
                   associations between recombination characteristics of
                   individuals and variants in the PRDM9 gene and we
                   identify new recombination hotspots. Comparisons of our
                   maps with two LD-based maps inferred from data of
                   HapMap populations of Utah residents with ancestry from
                   northern and western Europe (CEU) and Yoruba in Ibadan,

	Abstract = {Quantifying patterns of population structure in
                   Africans and African Americans illuminates the history
                   of human populations and is critical for undertaking
                   medical genomic studies on a global scale. To obtain a
                   fine-scale genome-wide perspective of ancestry, we
                   analyze Affymetrix GeneChip 500K genotype data from
                   African Americans (n = 365) and individuals with
                   ancestry from West Africa (n = 203 from 12 populations)
                   and Europe (n = 400 from 42 countries). We find that
                   population structure within the West African sample
                   reflects primarily language and secondarily
                   geographical distance, echoing the Bantu expansion.
                   Among African Americans, analysis of genomic admixture
                   by a principal component-based approach indicates that
                   the median proportion of European ancestry is 18.5\%
                   (25th-75th percentiles: 11.6-27.7\%), with very large
                   variation among individuals. In the African-American
                   sample as a whole, few autosomal regions showed
                   exceptionally high or low mean African ancestry, but
                   the X chromosome showed elevated levels of African
                   ancestry, consistent with a sex-biased pattern of gene
                   flow with an excess of European male and African female
                   ancestry. We also find that genomic profiles of
                   individual African Americans afford personalized
                   ancestry reconstructions differentiating ancient vs.
                   recent European and African ancestry. Finally, patterns
                   of genetic similarity among inferred African segments
                   of African-American genomes and genomes of contemporary
                   African populations included in this study suggest
                   African ancestry is most similar to non-Bantu
                   Niger-Kordofanian-speaking populations, consistent with
                   historical documents of the African Diaspora and
                   trans-Atlantic slave trade.},

                   map of the human genome through the study of 270
                   individuals from four populations with ancestry in
                   Europe, Africa or Asia (the HapMap collection). DNA
                   from these individuals was screened for CNV using two
                   complementary technologies: single-nucleotide
                   polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based
                   comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447
                   copy number variable regions (CNVRs), which can
                   encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or losses,
                   covering 360 megabases (12\% of the genome) were

                   hundreds of genes, disease loci, functional elements

                   encompassed more nucleotide content per genome than
                   SNPs, underscoring the importance of CNV in genetic
                   diversity and evolution. The data obtained delineate
                   linkage disequilibrium patterns for many CNVs, and
                   reveal marked variation in copy number among

	Abstract = {Little is known about the nature of recombination
                   hotspots in the human genome and the relationship
                   between crossover activity and patterns of linkage
                   disequilibrium. We have therefore used both haplotype
                   analysis and direct detection of crossovers in sperm to
                   characterize a putative recombination hotspot in the
                   TAP2 gene within the class II region of the MHC.
                   Haplotype diversity provided evidence for a localized
                   hotspot within intron 2 of this gene. Sperm DNA typing
                   using allele-specific PCR primers to selectively
                   amplify recombinant TAP2 molecules revealed a highly
                   localized meiotic crossover hotspot approximately 1.2
                   kb long, unusually abundant in sequence polymorphisms
                   and flanked by DNA much less active in recombination.
                   Sperm crossover appeared to be fully reciprocal, and
                   almost all crossover products were simple, involving a
                   single exchange between adjacent heterozygous markers.
                   This hotspot appears to be much more active in female
                   than male meiosis. No primary sequence similarities
                   could be found between any of the very few well defined
                   crossover hotspots in the human genome, all of which
                   show recombinationally active domains 1-2 kb long.
                   Direct comparison of recombination frequency and
                   haplotype diversity in TAP2 showed that linkage
                   disequilibrium measures were a poor predictor of
                   crossover frequency in this region, with
                   non-recombining markers sometimes in free association
                   and with examples of pairs of markers spanning the
                   recombination hotspot showing substantial or even
                   absolute linkage disequilibrium.},

                   ensuring the proper segregation of chromosomes. Recent
                   linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies
                   suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously
                   across the human genome, with most events occurring in
                   narrow "hotspots." To examine variation in fine-scale
                   recombination patterns among individuals, we used
                   dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data
                   collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers
                   with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed
                   that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in
                   males and females, with individual hotspots often
                   active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60\%
                   of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD
                   studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and
                   heritable variation among both males and females in the
                   proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots.},

                   accurate maps of their locations, frequencies and

	Abstract = {Despite great progress in identifying genetic variants
                   that influence human disease, most inherited risk
                   remains unexplained. A more complete understanding
                   requires genome-wide studies that fully examine less
                   common alleles in populations with a wide range of
                   ancestry. To inform the design and interpretation of
                   such studies, we genotyped 1.6 million common single
                   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,184 reference
                   individuals from 11 global populations, and sequenced
                   ten 100-kilobase regions in 692 of these individuals.
                   This integrated data set of common and rare alleles,
                   called 'HapMap 3', includes both SNPs and copy number
                   polymorphisms (CNPs). We characterized
                   population-specific differences among low-frequency
                   variants, measured the improvement in imputation
                   accuracy afforded by the larger reference panel,
                   especially in imputing SNPs with a minor allele
                   frequency of <or=5\%, and demonstrated the feasibility
                   of imputing newly discovered CNPs and SNPs. This
                   expanded public resource of genome variants in global
                   populations supports deeper interrogation of genomic
                   variation and its role in human disease, and serves as
                   a step towards a high-resolution map of the landscape

                   fraction of the genome. These hotspots of recombination
                   show considerable variation in intensity and/or
                   location across species and, potentially, across human
                   populations. On a larger scale, the patterns of
                   recombination rates have been mostly investigated in
                   individuals of European ancestry, and it remains
                   unknown whether the results obtained can be directly
                   applied to other human populations. Here, we
                   investigate this question using genome-wide
                   polymorphism data. We show that population
                   recombination rates recapitulate a large part of the
                   genetic map information, regardless of the population

                   population recombination rate estimate of two
                   populations is overall constant along the chromosomes.
                   These two observations support the hypothesis that
                   large-scale recombination patterns are conserved across
                   human populations. Local deviations from the overall
                   pattern of conservation of the recombination rates can

	Abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium--the nonrandom association of
                   alleles at different loci--is a sensitive indicator of
                   the population genetic forces that structure a genome.
                   Because of the explosive growth of methods for
                   assessing genetic variation at a fine scale,
                   evolutionary biologists and human geneticists are
                   increasingly exploiting linkage disequilibrium in order
                   to understand past evolutionary and demographic events,
                   to map genes that are associated with quantitative
                   characters and inherited diseases, and to understand
                   the joint evolution of linked sets of genes. This
                   article introduces linkage disequilibrium, reviews the
                   population genetic processes that affect it and
                   describes some of its uses. At present, linkage
                   disequilibrium is used much more extensively in the
                   study of humans than in non-humans, but that is
                   changing as technological advances make extensive
                   genomic studies feasible in other species.},

                   concentration. Sib-pair analyses of 10 markers in 345
                   full- and 219 half-sib pairs from 29 multiplex
                   Afro-Caribbean families provided evidence for linkage

                   asthma and high IgE. Using 6 of these markers and 11

	Abstract = {Genetic variation among individual humans occurs on
                   many different scales, ranging from gross alterations
                   in the human karyotype to single nucleotide changes.
                   Here we explore variation on an intermediate
                   scale--particularly insertions, deletions and
                   inversions affecting from a few thousand to a few
                   million base pairs. We employed a clone-based method to
                   interrogate this intermediate structural variation in
                   eight individuals of diverse geographic ancestry. Our
                   analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the
                   normal pattern of structural variation present in these
                   genomes, refining the location of 1,695 structural
                   variants. We find that 50\% were seen in more than one
                   individual and that nearly half lay outside regions of
                   the genome previously described as structurally
                   variant. We discover 525 new insertion sequences that
                   are not present in the human reference genome and show
                   that many of these are variable in copy number between
                   individuals. Complete sequencing of 261 structural
                   variants reveals considerable locus complexity and
                   provides insights into the different mutational
                   processes that have shaped the human genome. These data
                   provide the first high-resolution sequence map of human
                   structural variation--a standard for genotyping
                   platforms and a prelude to future individual genome

@article{Giglio2001,
	Abstract = {The olfactory receptor (OR)-gene superfamily is the
                   largest in the mammalian genome. Several of the human
                   OR genes appear in clusters with > or = 10 members
                   located on almost all human chromosomes, and some
                   chromosomes contain more than one cluster. We
                   demonstrate, by experimental and in silico data, that
                   unequal crossovers between two OR gene clusters in 8p
                   are responsible for the formation of three recurrent
                   chromosome macrorearrangements and a submicroscopic
                   inversion polymorphism. The first two
                   macrorearrangements are the inverted duplication of 8p,
                   inv dup(8p), which is associated with a distinct
                   phenotype, and a supernumerary marker chromosome,
                   +der(8)(8p23.1pter), which is also a recurrent
                   rearrangement and is associated with minor anomalies.
                   We demonstrate that it is the reciprocal of the inv
                   dup(8p). The third macrorearrangment is a recurrent
                   8p23 interstitial deletion associated with heart
                   defect. Since inv dup(8p)s originate consistently in
                   maternal meiosis, we investigated the maternal
                   chromosomes 8 in eight mothers of subjects with inv
                   dup(8p) and in the mother of one subject with +der(8),
                   by means of probes included between the two 8p-OR gene
                   clusters. All the mothers were heterozygous for an 8p
                   submicroscopic inversion that was delimited by the
                   8p-OR gene clusters and was present, in heterozygous
                   state, in 26\% of a population of European descent.
                   Thus, inversion heterozygosity may cause susceptibility
                   to unequal recombination, leading to the formation of
                   the inv dup(8p) or to its reciprocal product, the
                   +der(8p). After the Yp inversion polymorphism, which is
                   the preferential background for the PRKX/PRKY
                   translocation in XX males and XY females, the OR-8p
                   inversion is the second genomic polymorphism that
                   confers susceptibility to the formation of common
                   chromosome rearrangements. Accordingly, it may be
                   possible to develop a profile of the individual risk of
                   having progeny with chromosome rearrangements.},

                   in size account for most bases that vary among human
                   genomes, but are still relatively under-ascertained.
                   Here we use tiling oligonucleotide microarrays,
                   comprising 42 million probes, to generate a
                   comprehensive map of 11,700 copy number variations
                   (CNVs) greater than 443 base pairs, of which most
                   (8,599) have been validated independently. For 4,978 of
                   these CNVs, we generated reference genotypes from 450
                   individuals of European, African or East Asian
                   ancestry. The predominant mutational mechanisms differ
                   among CNV size classes. Retrotransposition has
                   duplicated and inserted some coding and non-coding DNA
                   segments randomly around the genome. Furthermore, by
                   correlation with known trait-associated single
                   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified 30 loci
                   with CNVs that are candidates for influencing disease
                   susceptibility. Despite this, having assessed the
                   completeness of our map and the patterns of linkage

	Abstract = {Copy number variants (CNVs) contribute to human
                   genetic and phenotypic diversity. However, the
                   distribution of larger CNVs in the general population
                   remains largely unexplored. We identify large variants
                   in approximately 2500 individuals by using Illumina SNP
                   data, with an emphasis on "hotspots" prone to recurrent
                   mutations. We find variants larger than 500 kb in
                   5\%-10\% of individuals and variants greater than 1 Mb
                   in 1\%-2\%. In contrast to previous studies, we find
                   limited evidence for stratification of CNVs in
                   geographically distinct human populations. Importantly,
                   our sample size permits a robust distinction between
                   truly rare and polymorphic but low-frequency copy
                   number variation. We find that a significant fraction
                   of individual CNVs larger than 100 kb are rare and that
                   both gene density and size are strongly anticorrelated
                   with allele frequency. Thus, although large CNVs
                   commonly exist in normal individuals, which suggests
                   that size alone can not be used as a predictor of
                   pathogenicity, such variation is generally deleterious.
                   Considering these observations, we combine our data
                   with published CNVs from more than 12,000 individuals
                   contrasting control and neurological disease
                   collections. This analysis identifies known disease
                   loci and highlights additional CNVs (e.g., 3q29, 16p12,
                   and 15q25.2) for further investigation. This study
                   provides one of the first analyses of large, rare
                   (0.1\%-1\%) CNVs in the general population, with

                   in which admixture occurs in a single generation, and
                   the continuous-gene-flow (CGF) model, in which
                   admixture occurs at a steady rate in every generation.
                   Linkage disequilibrium patterns in African American
                   population samples from Jackson, MS, and from coastal
                   South Carolina resemble patterns observed in the
                   simulated CGF populations, in two respects. First,
                   significant association between two loci (FY and AT3)
                   separated by 22 cM was detected in both samples. The
                   retention of ALD over relatively large (>10 cM)
                   chromosomal segments is characteristic of a CGF pattern
                   of admixture but not of an HI pattern. Second,
                   significant associations were also detected between
                   many pairs of unlinked loci, as observed in the CGF
                   simulation results but not in the simulated HI
                   populations. Such a high rate of association between
                   unlinked markers in these populations could result in
                   false-positive linkage signals in an admixture-mapping
                   study. However, we demonstrate that by conditioning on
                   parental admixture, we can distinguish between true
                   linkage and association resulting from shared ancestry.
                   Therefore, populations with a CGF history of admixture
                   not only are appropriate for admixture mapping but also
                   have greater power for detection of linkage
                   disequilibrium over large chromosomal regions than do
                   populations that have experienced a pattern of
                   admixture more similar to the HI model, if methods are
                   employed that detect and adjust for disequilibrium
                   caused by continuous admixture.},

                   demonstrate that a major player for hotspot
                   specification is the Prdm9 gene. First, two mouse
                   strains that differ in hotspot usage are polymorphic
                   for the zinc finger DNA binding array of PRDM9. Second,
                   the human consensus PRDM9 allele is predicted to
                   recognize the 13-mer motif enriched at human hotspots;
                   this DNA binding specificity is verified by in vitro

	Abstract = {PRDM9 has recently been identified as a likely trans
                   regulator of meiotic recombination hot spots in humans
                   and mice. PRDM9 contains a zinc finger array that, in
                   humans, can recognize a short sequence motif associated
                   with hot spots, with binding to this motif possibly
                   triggering hot-spot activity via chromatin remodeling.
                   We now report that human genetic variation at the PRDM9
                   locus has a strong effect on sperm hot-spot activity,
                   even at hot spots lacking the sequence motif. Subtle
                   changes within the zinc finger array can create
                   hot-spot nonactivating or enhancing variants and can
                   even trigger the appearance of a new hot spot,
                   suggesting that PRDM9 is a major global regulator of
                   hot spots in humans. Variation at the PRDM9 locus also
                   influences aspects of genome instability-specifically,
                   a megabase-scale rearrangement underlying two genomic
                   disorders as well as minisatellite
                   instability-implicating PRDM9 as a risk factor for some

                   human genome in ancestrally homogeneous populations for
                   hallmarks of selection. No genomewide studies have
                   focused on recently admixed groups--populations that
                   have experienced admixing among continentally divided
                   ancestral populations within the past 200-500 years.
                   New World admixed populations are unique in that they

                   diverged genomes with novel environmental challenges.
                   Here, we present a novel approach for studying
                   selection by examining the genomewide distribution of
                   ancestry in the genetically admixed Puerto Ricans. We

@article{Bergstrom1998,
	Abstract = {The HLA class I and class II loci are the most highly
                   polymorphic coding regions in the human genome. Based
                   on the similarity of the coding sequences of alleles
                   between species, it has been claimed that the HLA
                   polymorphism is ancient and predates the separation of
                   human (Homo) and chimpanzee (Pan), 4-7.4 Myr ago.
                   Analysis of intron sequences, however, provides support
                   for a more recent origin and for rapid generation of
                   alleles at the HLA class II DRB1 locus. The human DRB1
                   alleles can be divided into groups (allelic lineages);
                   most of these lineages have diverged from each other
                   before the separation of Homo and Pan. Alleles within
                   such a lineage, however, appear to be, on average,
                   250,000 years old, implying that the vast majority
                   (greater than 90\%) of the more than 135 contemporary
                   human DRB1 alleles have been generated after the
                   separation of Homo and Pan. The coalescence time of
                   alleles within allelic lineages indicates that the
                   effective population size (Ne) for early hominids (over
                   the last 1 Myr) was approximately 10(4) individuals,
                   similar to estimates based on other nuclear loci and
                   mitochondrial DNA. With a single exception, the genetic
                   mechanisms (gene conversion and point mutation) that
                   have diversified the exon-2 sequences do not appear to
                   extend into the adjacent intron sequences. The part of
                   exon 2 encoding the beta-sheet evolves in concert with
                   the surrounding introns, while the alpha-helix appears
                   to have been subjected to gene conversion-like events,
                   suggesting that such exchange events are highly
                   localised and occur over extremely short sequence
                   tracts.},

	Abstract = {We describe the genome sequencing of an anonymous
                   individual of African origin using a novel
                   ligation-based sequencing assay that enables a unique
                   form of error correction that improves the raw accuracy
                   of the aligned reads to >99.9\%, allowing us to
                   accurately call SNPs with as few as two reads per
                   allele. We collected several billion mate-paired reads
                   yielding approximately 18x haploid coverage of aligned
                   sequence and close to 300x clone coverage. Over 98\% of
                   the reference genome is covered with at least one
                   uniquely placed read, and 99.65\% is spanned by at
                   least one uniquely placed mate-paired clone. We
                   identify over 3.8 million SNPs, 19\% of which are
                   novel. Mate-paired data are used to physically resolve
                   haplotype phases of nearly two-thirds of the genotypes
                   obtained and produce phased segments of up to 215 kb.
                   We detect 226,529 intra-read indels, 5590 indels
                   between mate-paired reads, 91 inversions, and four gene
                   fusions. We use a novel approach for detecting indels
                   between mate-paired reads that are smaller than the
                   standard deviation of the insert size of the library
                   and discover deletions in common with those detected
                   with our intra-read approach. Dozens of mutations
                   previously described in OMIM and hundreds of
                   nonsynonymous single-nucleotide and structural variants
                   in genes previously implicated in disease are
                   identified in this individual. There is more genetic
                   variation in the human genome still to be uncovered,
                   and we provide guidance for future surveys in
                   populations and cancer biopsies.},

	Abstract = {In mammals, fertilization typically involves the
                   ovulation of one or a few eggs at one end of the female
                   reproductive tract and the entry of millions of sperm
                   at the other. Given this disparity in numbers, it might
                   be expected that the more precious commodity-eggs-would
                   be subject to more stringent quality-control
                   mechanisms. However, information from engineered
                   mutations of meiotic genes suggests just the opposite.
                   Specifically, the available mutants demonstrate
                   striking sexual dimorphism in response to meiotic
                   disruption; for example, faced with adversity, male
                   meiosis grinds to a halt, whereas female meiosis
                   soldiers on. This female "robustness" comes with a
                   cost, however, because aneuploidy appears to be
                   increased in the resultant oocytes.},

	Abstract = {The nature and scale of recombination rate variation
                   are largely unknown for most species. In humans,
                   pedigree analysis has documented variation at the
                   chromosomal level, and sperm studies have identified
                   specific hotspots in which crossing-over events
                   cluster. To address whether this picture is
                   representative of the genome as a whole, we have
                   developed and validated a method for estimating
                   recombination rates from patterns of genetic variation.
                   From extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys
                   in European and African populations, we find evidence
                   for extreme local rate variation spanning four orders
                   in magnitude, in which 50% of all recombination events
                   take place in less than 10% of the sequence. We
                   demonstrate that recombination hotspots are a
                   ubiquitous feature of the human genome, occurring on
                   average every 200 kilobases or less, but recombination
                   occurs preferentially outside genes.},

                   (SJK) and analysis results. The diploid genome of a
                   Korean male was sequenced to 28.95-fold redundancy
                   using the Illumina paired-end sequencing method. SJK
                   covered 99.9\% of the NCBI human reference genome. We
                   identified 420,083 novel single nucleotide
                   polymorphisms (SNPs) that are not in the dbSNP
                   database. Despite a close similarity, significant
                   differences were observed between the Chinese genome
                   (YH), the only other Asian genome available, and SJK:
                   (1) 39.87\% (1,371,239 out of 3,439,107) SNPs were
                   SJK-specific (49.51\% against Venter's, 46.94\% against
                   Watson's, and 44.17\% against the Yoruba genomes); (2)
                   99.5\% (22,495 out of 22,605) of short indels (< 4 bp)
                   discovered on the same loci had the same size and type
                   as YH; and (3) 11.3\% (331 out of 2920) deletion
                   structural variants were SJK-specific. Even after
                   attempting to map unmapped reads of SJK to unanchored
                   NCBI scaffolds, HGSV, and available personal genomes,
                   there were still 5.77\% SJK reads that could not be
                   mapped. All these findings indicate that the overall
                   genetic differences among individuals from closely
                   related ethnic groups may be significant. Hence,
                   constructing reference genomes for minor socio-ethnic

	Abstract = {A method for simultaneously estimating the admixture
                   proportions of a hybrid population and Wright's
                   fixation index, FST, for that hybrid is presented. It
                   is shown that the variance of admixture estimates can
                   be partitioned into two components: (1) due to sample
                   size, and (2) due to evolutionary variance (i.e.,
                   genetic drift). A chi-square test used to detect
                   heterogeneity of admixture estimates from different
                   alleles, or loci, can now be corrected for both sources
                   of random errors. Hence, its value for the detection of
                   natural selection from heterogeneous admixture
                   estimates is improved. The estimation and testing
                   procedures described above are independent of the
                   dynamics of the admixture process. However, when the
                   admixture dynamics can be specified, FST can be
                   predicted from genetic principles. Two admixture models
                   are considered here, gene flow and intermixture. These
                   models are of value because they lead to very different
                   predictions regarding the accumulation of genes from
                   the parental populations and the accumulation of
                   variance due to genetic drift. When there is not
                   evidence for natural selection, and it is appropriate
                   to apply these models to data, the variance effective
                   size (Ne) of the hybrid population can be estimated.
                   Applications are made to three human populations: two
                   of these are Afro-American populations and one is a
                   Yanomamo Indian village. Natural selection could not be
                   detected using the chi-square test in any of these
                   populations. However, estimates of effective population
                   sizes do lead to a richer description of the genetic

	Abstract = {Recently it has been reported that recombination
                   hotspots appear to be highly variable between humans
                   and chimpanzees, and there is evidence for
                   between-person variability in hotspots, and
                   evolutionary transience. To understand the nature of
                   variation in human recombination rates, it is important
                   to describe patterns of variability across populations.
                   Direct measurement of recombination rates remains
                   infeasible on a large scale, and population-genetic
                   approaches can be imprecise, and are affected by
                   demographic history. Reports to date have suggested
                   broad similarity in recombination rates at large
                   genomic scales and across human populations. Here, we
                   examine recombination rate estimates at a finer
                   population and genomic scale: 28 worldwide populations
                   and 107 SNPs in a 1Mb stretch of chromosome 22q. We
                   employ analysis of variance of recombination rate
                   estimates, corrected for differences in effective
                   population size using genome-wide microsatellite
                   mutation rate estimates. We find substantial variation
                   in fine-scale rates between populations, but reduced
                   variation within continental groups. All effects
                   examined (SNP-pair, region, population and
                   interactions) were highly significant. Adjustment for
                   effective population size made little difference to the
                   conclusions. Observed hotspots tended to be conserved
                   across populations, albeit at varying intensities. This
                   holds particularly for populations from the same
                   region, and also to a considerable degree across
                   geographical regions. However, some hotspots appear to
                   be population-specific. Several results from studies on
                   the population history of humans are in accordance with
                   our analysis. Our results suggest that
                   between-population variation in DNA sequences may
                   underly recombination rate variation. },

                   specific hybridization of amplified gDNA to 50-mer
                   probe arrays. After target capture, SNPs are genotyped
                   on the array by a primer extension reaction in the
                   presence of hapten-labeled nucleotides. The resultant

	Abstract = {The Uyghur (UIG) population, settled in Xinjiang, China, is a population presenting a typical admixture of Eastern and Western anthropometric traits. We dissected its genomic structure at population level, individual level, and chromosome level by using 20,177 SNPs spanning nearly the entire chromosome 21. Our results showed that UIG was formed by two-way admixture, with 60\% European ancestry and 40\% East Asian ancestry. Overall linkage disequilibrium (LD) in UIG was similar to that in its parental populations represented in East Asia and Europe with regard to common alleles, and UIG manifested elevation of LD only within 500 kb and at a level of 0.1 <r(2) < 0.8 when ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) were used. The size of chromosomal segments that were derived from East Asian and European ancestries averaged 2.4 cM and 4.1 cM, respectively. Both the magnitude of LD and fragmentary ancestral chromosome segments indicated a long history of Uyghur. Under the assumption of a hybrid isolation (HI) model, we estimated that the admixture event of UIG occurred about 126 [107 approximately 146] generations ago, or 2520 [2140 approximately 2920] years ago assuming 20 years per generation. In spite of the long history and short LD of Uyghur compared with recent admixture populations such as the African-American population, we suggest that mapping by admixture LD (MALD) is still applicable in the Uyghur population but approximately 10-fold AIMs are necessary for a whole-genome scan.},

A simple maximum-likelihood estimator of allele age based on frequency is also obtained. The distribution of allele age, combined with a model predicting the extent of intra-allelic variability generated by mutation and recombination, leads to a statistical test of whether a rare allele has experienced natural selection. The test is based on finding whether there is too little or too much intra-allelic variability to be consistent with the observed frequency. The test is applied to the locus, BRCA1, associated with early-onset breast cancer in humans and shows that two common disease-associated alleles (5382insC and 185delAG) appear to have been subject to natural selection.},

	Abstract = {The age of an allele can be estimated both from genetic variation among different copies (intra-allelic variation) and from its frequency. Estimates based on intra-allelic variation follow from the exponential decay of linkage disequilibrium because of recombination and mutation. The confidence interval depends both on the uncertainty in recombination and mutation rates and on randomness of the genealogy of chromosomes that carry the allele (the intra-allelic genealogy). Several approximate methods to account for variation in the intra-allelic genealogy have been derived. Allele frequency alone also provides an estimate of age. Estimates based on frequency and on intra-allelic variability can be combined to provide a more accurate estimate or can be contrasted to show that an allele has been subject to natural selection. These methods have been applied to numerous cases, including alleles associated with cystic fibrosis, idiopathic torsion dystonia, and resistance to infection by HIV. We emphasize that estimates of allele age depend on assumptions about demographic history and natural selection.},

Haploid markers from mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome have proven invaluable for generating a standard model for evolution of modern humans. Conclusions from earlier research on protein polymorphisms have been generally supported by more sophisticated DNA analysis. Co-evolution of genes with language and some slowly evolving cultural traits, together with the genetic evolution of commensals and parasites that have accompanied modern humans in their expansion from Africa to the other continents, supports and supplements the standard model of genetic evolution.

	Abstract = {Following up on our previous study, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of admixture for two Uyghur population samples (HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG), collected from the northern and southern regions of Xinjiang in China, respectively. Both HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG showed a substantial admixture of East-{A}sian (EAS) and European (EUR) ancestries, with an empirical estimation of ancestry contribution of 53:47 (EAS:EUR) and 48:52 for HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG, respectively. The effective admixture time under a model with a single pulse of admixture was estimated as 110 generations and 129 generations, or admixture events occurred about 2200 and 2580 years ago for HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG, respectively, assuming an average of 20 yr per generation. Despite Uyghurs' earlier history compared to other admixture populations, admixture mapping, holds promise for this population, because of its large size and its mixture of ancestry from different continents. We screened multiple databases and identified a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism panel that can distinguish EAS and EUR ancestry of chromosomal segments in Uyghurs. The panel contains 8150 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) showing large frequency differences between EAS and EUR populations (F(ST) > 0.25, mean F(ST) = 0.43) but small frequency differences (7999 AIMs validated) within both populations (F(ST) < 0.05, mean F(ST) < 0.01). We evaluated the effectiveness of this admixture map for localizing disease genes in two Uyghur populations. To our knowledge, our map constitutes the first practical resource for admixture mapping in Uyghurs, and it will enable studies of diseases showing differences in genetic risk between EUR and EAS populations.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput genotyping data are useful for making inferences about human evolutionary history. However, the populations sampled to date are unevenly distributed, and some areas (e.g., South and Central Asia) have rarely been sampled in large-scale studies. To assess human genetic variation more evenly, we sampled 296 individuals from 13 worldwide populations that are not covered by previous studies. By combining these samples with a data set from our laboratory and the HapMap II samples, we assembled a final dataset of ~250,000 {SNP}s in 850 individuals from 40 populations. With more uniform sampling, the estimate of global genetic differentiation (F(ST)) substantially decreases from ~16\% with the HapMap II samples to ~11\%. A panel of copy number variations typed in the same populations shows patterns of diversity similar to the {SNP} data, with highest diversity in African populations. This unique sample collection also permits new inferences about human evolutionary history. The comparison of haplotype variation among populations supports a single out-of-Africa migration event and suggests that the founding population of Eurasia may have been relatively large but isolated from Africans for a period of time. We also found a substantial affinity between populations from central Asia (Kyrgyzstani and Mongolian Buryat) and America, suggesting a central {A}sian contribution to New World founder populations.},

	Abstract = {Various observations argue for a role of adaptation in recent human evolution, including results from genome-wide studies and analyses of selection signals at candidate genes. Here, we use genome-wide {SNP} data from the HapMap and CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel samples to study the geographic distributions of putatively selected alleles at a range of geographic scales. We find that the average allele frequency divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme F(ST) values across the whole genome. On a broad scale, the geographic distribution of putatively selected alleles almost invariably conforms to population clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often weak enough that neutral processes -- especially population history, migration, and drift -- exert powerful influences over the fate and geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide scans for recent positive selection in humans have yielded insight into the mechanisms underlying the extensive phenotypic diversity in our species, but have focused on a limited number of populations. Here, we present an analysis of recent selection in a global sample of 53 populations, using genotype data from the Human Genome Diversity-CEPH Panel. We refine the geographic distributions of known selective sweeps, and find extensive overlap between these distributions for populations in the same continental region but limited overlap between populations outside these groupings. We present several examples of previously unrecognized candidate targets of selection, including signals at a number of genes in the NRG-ERBB4 developmental pathway in non-African populations. Analysis of recently identified genes involved in complex diseases suggests that there has been selection on loci involved in susceptibility to type II diabetes. Finally, we search for local adaptation between geographically close populations, and highlight several examples.},

Here, we applied Sanger sequencing of genomic PCR amplicons to resequence the diabetes-associated genes KCNJ11 and HHEX in 13,715 people (10,422 European Americans and 3,293 African Americans) and validated amplicons potentially harbouring rare variants using 454 pyrosequencing. We observed far more variation (expected variant-site count  approximately 578) than would have been predicted on the basis of earlier surveys, which could only capture the distribution of common variants. By comparison with earlier estimates based on common variants, our model shows a clear genetic signal of accelerating population growth, suggesting that humanity harbours a myriad of rare, deleterious variants, and that disease risk and the burden of disease in contemporary populations may be heavily influenced by the distribution of rare variants.},

Our estimation method as coded in migrate is tested against genetree; both programs deliver a very similar likelihood surface.

@article{Felsenstein:2006xd,
	Abstract = {A computer simulation study has been made of the accuracy of estimates of Theta = 4Nemu from a sample from a single isolated population of finite size. The accuracies turn out to be well predicted by a formula developed by Fu and Li, who used optimistic assumptions. Their formulas are restated in terms of accuracy, defined here as the reciprocal of the squared coefficient of variation. This should be proportional to sample size when the entities sampled provide independent information. Using these formulas for accuracy, the sampling strategy for estimation of Theta can be investigated. Two models for cost have been used, a cost-per-base model and a cost-per-read model. The former would lead us to prefer to have a very large number of loci, each one base long. The latter, which is more realistic, causes us to prefer to have one read per locus and an optimum sample size which declines as costs of sampling organisms increase. For realistic values, the optimum sample size is 8 or fewer individuals. This is quite close to the results obtained by Pluzhnikov and Donnelly for a cost-per-base model, evaluating other estimators of Theta. It can be understood by considering that the resources spent collecting larger samples prevent us from considering more loci. An examination of the efficiency of Watterson's estimator of Theta was also made, and it was found to be reasonably efficient when the number of mutants per generation in the sequence in the whole population is less than 2.5.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a pruning algorithm for likelihood estimation of a tree of populations. This algorithm enables us to compute the likelihood for large trees. Thus, it gives an efficient way of obtaining the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) for a given tree topology. Our method utilizes the differences accumulated by random genetic drift in allele count data from single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s), ignoring the effect of mutation after divergence from the common ancestral population. The computation of the maximum-likelihood tree involves both maximizing likelihood over branch lengths of a given topology and comparing the maximum-likelihood across topologies. Here our focus is the maximization of likelihood over branch lengths of a given topology. The pruning algorithm computes arrays of probabilities at the root of the tree from the data at the tips of the tree; at the root, the arrays determine the likelihood. The arrays consist of probabilities related to the number of coalescences and allele counts for the partially coalesced lineages. Computing these probabilities requires an unusual two-stage algorithm. Our computation is exact and avoids time-consuming Monte Carlo methods. We can also correct for ascertainment bias.},

	Abstract = {Determining historical sex ratios throughout human evolution can provide insight into patterns of genomic variation, the structure and composition of ancient populations, and the cultural factors that influence the sex ratio (e.g., sex-specific migration rates). Although numerous studies have suggested that unequal sex ratios have existed in human evolutionary history, a coherent picture of sex-biased processes has yet to emerge. For example, two recent studies compared human {X} chromosome to autosomal variation to make inferences about historical sex ratios but reached seemingly contradictory conclusions, with one study finding evidence for a male bias and the other study identifying a female bias. Here, we show that a large part of this discrepancy can be explained by methodological differences. Specifically, through reanalysis of empirical data, derivation of explicit analytical formulae, and extensive simulations we demonstrate that two estimators of the effective sex ratio based on population structure and nucleotide diversity preferentially detect biases that have occurred on different timescales. Our results clarify apparently contradictory evidence on the role of sex-biased processes in human evolutionary history and show that extant patterns of human genomic variation are consistent with both a recent male bias and an earlier, persistent female bias.},

	Abstract = {In a series of highly influential publications, Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues used principal component (PC) analysis to produce maps depicting how human genetic diversity varies across geographic space. Within Europe, the first axis of variation (PC1) was interpreted as evidence for the demic diffusion model of agriculture, in which farmers expanded from the Near East approximately 10,000 years ago and replaced the resident hunter-gatherer populations with little or no interbreeding. These interpretations of the PC maps have been recently questioned as the original results can be reproduced under models of spatially covarying allele frequencies without any expansion. Here, we study PC maps for data simulated under models of range expansion and admixture. Our simulations include a spatially realistic model of Neolithic farmer expansion and assume various levels of interbreeding between farmer and resident hunter-gatherer populations. An important result is that under a broad range of conditions, the gradients in PC1 maps are oriented along a direction perpendicular to the axis of the expansion, rather than along the same axis as the expansion. We propose that this surprising pattern is an outcome of the "allele surfing" phenomenon, which creates sectors of high allele-frequency differentiation that align perpendicular to the direction of the expansion.},

@article{Wilkins:2006hs,
	Abstract = {Different patterns of mitochondrial and Y-chromosome diversity have been cited as evidence of long-term patrilocality in human populations. However, what patterns are expected depends on the nature of the sampling scheme. Samples from a local region reveal only the recent demographic history of that region, whereas sampling over larger geographic scales accesses older demographic processes. A historical change in migration becomes evident first at local geographic scales, and alters global patterns of genetic diversity only after sufficient time has passed. Analysis of forager populations in the ethnographic record suggests that patrilocality may not have predominated among pre-agricultural humans. The higher female migration rate inferred by some genetic studies may reflect a shift to patrilocality in association with the emergence of agriculture. A recent global survey does not show the expected effects of higher female migration, possibly because the sampling scheme used for this study is accessing pre-agricultural human migration patterns. In this paper, we show how the demographic shift associated with agriculture might affect genetic diversity over different spatial scales. We also consider the prospects for studying sex-biased migration using the X-linked and autosomal markers. These multi-locus comparisons have the potential of providing more robust estimates of sex differences than Y-linked and mitochondrial data, but only if a very large number of loci are included in the analysis.},

	Abstract = {We propose a novel approximate-likelihood method to fit demographic models to human genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) data. We divide the genome into windows of constant genetic map width and then tabulate the number of distinct haplotypes and the frequency of the most common haplotype for each window. We summarize the data by the genomewide joint distribution of these two statistics-termed the HCN statistic. Coalescent simulations are used to generate the expected HCN statistic for different demographic parameters. The HCN statistic provides additional information for disentangling complex demography beyond statistics based on single-{SNP} frequencies. Application of our method to simulated data shows it can reliably infer parameters from growth and bottleneck models, even in the presence of recombination hotspots when properly modeled. We also examined how practical problems with genomewide data sets, such as errors in the genetic map, haplotype phase uncertainty, and {SNP} ascertainment bias, affect our method. Several modifications of our method served to make it robust to these problems. We have applied our method to data collected by Perlegen Sciences and find evidence for a severe population size reduction in northwestern Europe starting 32,500-47,500 years ago.},

@article{Wakeley:2001ud,
	Abstract = {A method of historical inference that accounts for ascertainment bias is developed and applied to single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) data in humans. The data consist of 84 short fragments of the genome that were selected, from three recent {SNP} surveys, to contain at least two polymorphisms in their respective ascertainment samples and that were then fully resequenced in 47 globally distributed individuals. Ascertainment bias is the deviation, from what would be observed in a random sample, caused either by discovery of polymorphisms in small samples or by locus selection based on levels or patterns of polymorphism. The three {SNP} surveys from which the present data were derived differ both in their protocols for ascertainment and in the size of the samples used for discovery. We implemented a Monte Carlo maximum-likelihood method to fit a subdivided-population model that includes a possible change in effective size at some time in the past. Incorrectly assuming that ascertainment bias does not exist causes errors in inference, affecting both estimates of migration rates and historical changes in size. Migration rates are overestimated when ascertainment bias is ignored. However, the direction of error in inferences about changes in effective population size (whether the population is inferred to be shrinking or growing) depends on whether either the numbers of {SNP}s per fragment or the {SNP}-allele frequencies are analyzed. We use the abbreviation "SDL," for "{SNP}-discovered locus," in recognition of the genomic-discovery context of {SNP}s. When ascertainment bias is modeled fully, both the number of {SNP}s per SDL and their allele frequencies support a scenario of growth in effective size in the context of a subdivided population. If subdivision is ignored, however, the hypothesis of constant effective population size cannot be rejected. An important conclusion of this work is that, in demographic or other studies, {SNP} data are useful only to the extent that their ascertainment can be modeled.},

Almost all of the available {SNP} loci, however, have been identified through a {SNP} discovery protocol that will influence the allelic distributions in the sampled loci. Standard methods for population genetic analysis based on the available {SNP} data will, therefore, be biased. This paper discusses the effect of this ascertainment bias on allelic distributions and on methods for quantifying linkage disequilibrium and estimating demographic parameters. Several recently developed methods for correcting for the ascertainment bias will also be discussed.},

	Abstract = {Chip-based high-throughput genotyping has facilitated genome-wide studies of genetic diversity. Many studies have utilized these large data sets to make inferences about the demographic history of human populations using measures of genetic differentiation such as F(ST) or principal component analyses. However, the single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) chip data suffer from ascertainment biases caused by the {SNP} discovery process in which a small number of individuals from selected populations are used as discovery panels. In this study, we investigate the effect of the ascertainment bias on inferences regarding genetic differentiation among populations in one of the common genome-wide genotyping platforms. We generate {SNP} genotyping data for individuals that previously have been subject to partial genome-wide Sanger sequencing and compare inferences based on genotyping data to inferences based on direct sequencing. In addition, we also analyze publicly available genome-wide data. We demonstrate that the ascertainment biases will distort measures of human diversity and possibly change conclusions drawn from these measures in some times unexpected ways. We also show that details of the genotyping calling algorithms can have a surprisingly large effect on population genetic inferences. We not only present a correction of the spectrum for the widely used Affymetrix {SNP} chips but also show that such corrections are difficult to generalize among studies.},

	Abstract = {Population stratification is a potential problem for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), confounding results and causing spurious associations. Hence, understanding how allele frequencies vary across geographic regions or among subpopulations is an important prelude to analyzing GWAS data. Using over 350,000 genome-wide autosomal {SNP}s in over 6000 Han Chinese samples from ten provinces of China, our study revealed a one-dimensional "north-south" population structure and a close correlation between geography and the genetic structure of the Han Chinese. The north-south population structure is consistent with the historical migration pattern of the Han Chinese population. Metropolitan cities in China were, however, more diffused "outliers," probably because of the impact of modern migration of peoples. At a very local scale within the Guangdong province, we observed evidence of population structure among dialect groups, probably on account of endogamy within these dialects. Via simulation, we show that empirical levels of population structure observed across modern China can cause spurious associations in GWAS if not properly handled. In the Han Chinese, geographic matching is a good proxy for genetic matching, particularly in validation and candidate-gene studies in which population stratification cannot be directly accessed and accounted for because of the lack of genome-wide data, with the exception of the metropolitan cities, where geographical location is no longer a good indicator of ancestral origin. Our findings are important for designing GWAS in the Chinese population, an activity that is expected to intensify greatly in the near future.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We sought to examine the magnitude of the differences in {SNP} allele frequencies between five European populations (Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Bulgaria and Portugal) and to identify the loci with the greatest differences. Methods: We performed a population-based genome-wide association analysis with Affymetrix 6.0 and 5.0 arrays. We used a 4 degrees of freedom chi(2) test to determine the magnitude of stratification for each {SNP}. We then examined the genes within the most stratified regions, using a highly conservative cutoff of p < 10(-45). Results: We found 40,593 {SNP}s which are genome-wide significantly (p </= 10(-8)) stratified between these populations. The largest differences clustered in gene ontology categories for immunity and pigmentation. Some of the top loci span genes that have already been reported as highly stratified: genes for hair color and pigmentation (HERC2, EXOC2, IRF4), the LCT gene, genes involved in NAD metabolism, and in immunity (HLA and the Toll-like receptor genes TLR10, TLR1, TLR6). However, several genes have not previously been reported as stratified within European populations, indicating that they might also have provided selective advantages: several zinc finger genes, two genes involved in glutathione synthesis or function, and most intriguingly, FOXP2, implicated in speech development. Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that many {SNP}s show genome-wide significant differences within European populations and the magnitude of the differences correlate with the geographical distance. At least some of these differences are due to the selective advantage of polymorphisms within these loci.},

	Abstract = {Analyzing genetic variation of human populations for detecting loci that have been affected by positive natural selection is important for understanding adaptive history and phenotypic variation in humans. In this study, we analyzed recent positive selection in Northern Europe from genome-wide data sets of 250 000 and 500 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s) in a total of 999 individuals from Great Britain, Northern Germany, Eastern and Western Finland, and Sweden. Coalescent simulations were used for demonstrating that the integrated haplotype score (iHS) and long-range haplotype (LRH) statistics have sufficient power in genome-wide data sets of different sample sizes and {SNP} densities. Furthermore, the behavior of the F(ST) statistic in closely related populations was characterized by allele frequency simulations. In the analysis of the North European data set, 60 regions in the genome showed strong signs of recent positive selection. Out of these, 21 regions have not been discovered in previous scans, and many contain genes with interesting functions (eg, RAB38, INFG, NOS1AP, and APOE). In the putatively selected regions, we observed a statistically significant overrepresentation of genetic association with complex disease, which emphasizes the importance of the analysis of positive selection in understanding the evolution of human disease. Altogether, this study demonstrates the potential of genome-wide data sets to discover loci that lie behind evolutionary adaptation in different human populations.},

	Abstract = {Older Puerto Ricans living in the continental U.S. suffer from higher rates of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and depression compared to non-Hispanic White populations. Complex diseases, such as these, are likely due to multiple, potentially interacting, genetic, environmental and social risk factors. Presumably, many of these environmental and genetic risk factors are contextual. We reasoned that racial background may modify some of these risk factors and be associated with health disparities among Puerto Ricans. The contemporary Puerto Rican population is genetically heterogeneous and originated from three ancestral populations: European settlers, native Ta{\'\i}no Indians, and West Africans. This rich-mixed ancestry of Puerto Ricans provides the intrinsic variability needed to untangle complex gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility and severity. Herein, we determined whether a specific ancestral background was associated with either of four major disease outcomes (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and depression). We estimated the genetic ancestry of 1,129 subjects from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study based on genotypes of 100 ancestry informative markers (AIMs). We examined the effects of ancestry on tests of association between single AIMs and disease traits. The ancestral composition of this population was 57.2\% European, 27.4\% African, and 15.4\% Native American. African ancestry was negatively associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and positively correlated with hypertension. It is likely that the high prevalence rate of diabetes in Africans, Hispanics, and Native Americans is not due to genetic variation alone, but to the combined effects of genetic variation interacting with environmental and social factors.},

This online database catalogs information and summaries on genotype and phased haplotype data, including allele frequencies, assessment of linkage disequilibrium (LD), and recombination rates in a format similar to the International HapMap Project. Here, we introduce this resource and describe the analysis of human genomic variation upon agglomerating data from the HapMap and the Human Genome Diversity Project, providing useful insights into the population structure of the three major population groups in Asia. In addition, this resource also surveyed across the genome for variation in regional patterns of LD between the HapMap and SGVP populations, and for signatures of positive natural selection using two well-established metrics: iHS and XP-EHH. The raw and processed genetic data, together with all population genetic summaries, are publicly available for download and browsing through a web browser modeled with the Generic Genome Browser.},

	Abstract = {To date, most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and studies of fine-scale population structure have been conducted primarily on Europeans. Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, composing 20\% of the entire global human population, is largely underrepresented in such studies. A well-recognized challenge is the fact that population structure can cause spurious associations in GWAS. In this study, we examined population substructures in a diverse set of over 1700 Han Chinese samples collected from 26 regions across China, each genotyped at approximately 160K single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s). Our results showed that the Han Chinese population is intricately substructured, with the main observed clusters corresponding roughly to northern Han, central Han, and southern Han. However, simulated case-control studies showed that genetic differentiation among these clusters, although very small (F(ST) = 0.0002 approximately 0.0009), is sufficient to lead to an inflated rate of false-positive results even when the sample size is moderate. The top two {SNP}s with the greatest frequency differences between the northern Han and southern Han clusters (F(ST) > 0.06) were found in the FADS2 gene, which associates with the fatty acid composition in phospholipids, and in the HLA complex P5 gene (HCP5), which associates with HIV infection, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that most differentiated genes among clusters are involved in cardiac arteriopathy (p < 10(-101)). These signals indicating significant differences among Han Chinese subpopulations should be carefully explained in case they are also detected in association studies, especially when sample sources are diverse.},

Here, we examined Japanese population structure by "Eigenanalysis," using the genotypes for 140,387 {SNP}s in 7003 Japanese individuals, along with 60 European, 60 African, and 90 East-{A}sian individuals, in the HapMap project. Most Japanese individuals fell into two main clusters, Hondo and Ryukyu; the Hondo cluster includes most of the individuals from the main islands in Japan, and the Ryukyu cluster includes most of the individuals from Okinawa. The {SNP}s with the greatest frequency differences between the Hondo and Ryukyu clusters were found in the HLA region in chromosome 6. The nonsynonymous {SNP}s with the greatest frequency differences between the Hondo and Ryukyu clusters were the Val/Ala polymorphism (rs3827760) in the EDAR gene, associated with hair thickness, and the Gly/Ala polymorphism (rs17822931) in the ABCC11 gene, associated with ear-wax type. Genetic differentiation was observed, even among different regions in Honshu Island, the largest island of Japan. Simulation studies showed that the inclusion of different proportions of individuals from different regions of Japan in case and control groups can lead to an inflated rate of false-positive results when the sample sizes are large.},

	Abstract = {We report a genome-wide association (GWA) study of severe malaria in The Gambia. The initial GWA scan included 2,500 children genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K GeneChip, and a replication study included 3,400 children. We used this to examine the performance of GWA methods in Africa. We found considerable population stratification, and also that signals of association at known malaria resistance loci were greatly attenuated owing to weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). To investigate possible solutions to the problem of low LD, we focused on the HbS locus, sequencing this region of the genome in 62 Gambian individuals and then using these data to conduct multipoint imputation in the GWA samples. This increased the signal of association, from P = 4 × 10(-7) to P = 4 × 10(-14), with the peak of the signal located precisely at the HbS causal variant. Our findings provide proof of principle that fine-resolution multipoint imputation, based on population-specific sequencing data, can substantially boost authentic GWA signals and enable fine mapping of causal variants in African populations.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic admixture is a common caveat for genetic association analysis. Therefore, it is important to characterize the genetic structure of the population under study to control for this kind of potential bias. RESULTS: In this study we have sampled over 800 unrelated individuals from the population of Spain, and have genotyped them with a genome-wide coverage. We have carried out linkage disequilibrium, haplotype, population structure and copy-number variation (CNV) analyses, and have compared these estimates of the Spanish population with existing data from similar efforts. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the Spanish population is similar to the Western and Northern Europeans, but has a more diverse haplotypic structure. Moreover, the Spanish population is also largely homogeneous within itself, although patterns of micro-structure may be able to predict locations of origin from distant regions. Finally, we also present the first characterization of a CNV map of the Spanish population. These results and original data are made available to the scientific community.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified common variants that are associated with a variety of traits and diseases, but most studies have been performed in European-derived populations. Here, we describe the first genome-wide analyses of imputed genotype and copy number variants (CNVs) for anthropometric measures in African-derived populations: 1188 Nigerians from Igbo-Ora and Ibadan, Nigeria, and 743 African-Americans from Maywood, IL. To improve the reach of our study, we used imputation to estimate genotypes at approximately 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s) and also tested CNVs for association. No {SNP}s or common CNVs reached a genome-wide significance level for association with height or body mass index (BMI), and the best signals from a meta-analysis of the two cohorts did not replicate in approximately 3700 African-Americans and Jamaicans. However, several loci previously confirmed in European populations showed evidence of replication in our GWA panel of African-derived populations, including variants near IHH and DLEU7 for height and MC4R for BMI. Analysis of global burden of rare CNVs suggested that lean individuals possess greater total burden of CNVs, but this finding was not supported in an independent European population. Our results suggest that there are not multiple loci with strong effects on anthropometric traits in African-derived populations and that sample sizes comparable to those needed in European GWA studies will be required to identify replicable associations. Meta-analysis of this data set with additional studies in African-ancestry populations will be helpful to improve power to detect novel associations.},

A more complete understanding requires genome-wide studies that fully examine less common alleles in populations with a wide range of ancestry. To inform the design and interpretation of such studies, we genotyped 1.6 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s) in 1,184 reference individuals from 11 global populations, and sequenced ten 100-kilobase regions in 692 of these individuals. This integrated data set of common and rare alleles, called 'HapMap 3', includes both {SNP}s and copy number polymorphisms (CNPs). We characterized population-specific differences among low-frequency variants, measured the improvement in imputation accuracy afforded by the larger reference panel, especially in imputing {SNP}s with a minor allele frequency of <or=5\%, and demonstrated the feasibility of imputing newly discovered CNPs and {SNP}s. This expanded public resource of genome variants in global populations supports deeper interrogation of genomic variation and its role in human disease, and serves as a step towards a high-resolution map of the landscape of human genetic variation.},

We compared genetic variation and substructure between Malawians and other African and non-African HapMap populations. Allele frequencies and adjacent linkage disequilibrium (LD) were measured for 617 715 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s) across subject genomes. Allele frequencies in the Malawian population (N=226) were highly correlated with allele frequencies in HapMap populations of African ancestry (AFA, N=376), namely Yoruban in Ibadan, Nigeria (Spearman's r(2)=0.97), Luhya in Webuye, Kenya (r(2)=0.97), African Americans in the southwest United States (r(2)=0.94) and Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya (r(2)=0.91). This correlation was much lower between Malawians and other ancestry populations (r(2)<0.52). LD correlations between Malawians and HapMap populations were strongest for the populations of AFA (AFA r(2)>0.82, other ancestries r(2)<0.57). Principal components analyses revealed little population substructure within our Malawi sample but provided clear distinction between Malawians, AFA populations and two European populations. Five {SNP}s within the lactase gene (LCT) had substantially different allele frequencies between the Malawi population and Maasai in Kenyawa, Kenya (rs3769013, rs730005, rs3769012, rs2304370; P-values <1 x 10(-33)).},

	Abstract = {The genetic structure of the indigenous hunter-gatherer peoples of southern Africa, the oldest known lineage of modern human, is important for understanding human diversity. Studies based on mitochondrial and small sets of nuclear markers have shown that these hunter-gatherers, known as Khoisan, San, or Bushmen, are genetically divergent from other humans. However, until now, fully sequenced human genomes have been limited to recently diverged populations. Here we present the complete genome sequences of an indigenous hunter-gatherer from the Kalahari Desert and a Bantu from southern Africa, as well as protein-coding regions from an additional three hunter-gatherers from disparate regions of the Kalahari. We characterize the extent of whole-genome and exome diversity among the five men, reporting 1.3 million novel DNA differences genome-wide, including 13,146 novel amino acid variants. In terms of nucleotide substitutions, the Bushmen seem to be, on average, more different from each other than, for example, a European and an {A}sian.

@article{Patterson:2010ff,
	Abstract = {STATEMENT: In naming population groups, we think a chief aim is to use terms that the group members use themselves, or find familiar and comfortable. The terms used in this manuscript to describe populations are as historically correct as possible and are chosen so as not to offend any population group. Two of the authors (DCP and REvdR) belong to the Coloured population, with one of the authors (REvdR) having contributed extensively to current literature on the history of the Coloured people of South Africa and served as Vice-President of the South African Institute of Race Relations. According to the 2001 South African census (http://www.statssa.gov.za/census01/HTML/CInBrief/CIB2001.pdf), "Statistics South Africa continues to classify people by population group, in order to monitor progress in moving away from the apartheid-based discrimination of the past. However, membership of a population group is now based on self-perception and self-classification, not on a legal definition. Five options were provided on the questionnaire, Black African, Coloured, Indian or {A}sian, White and Other. Responses in the category 'Other' were very few and were therefore imputed". We have elected to use the term Bushmen rather than San to refer to the hunter-gatherer people of Southern Africa. Although they have no collective name for themselves, this decision was based on the term Bushmen (or Bossiesman) being the more familiar to the communities themselves, while the term San is the more accepted academic classification. Understanding human genetic structure has fundamental implications for understanding the evolution and impact of human diseases. In this study, we describe the complex genetic substructure of a unique and recently admixed population arising approximately 350 years ago as a direct result of European settlement in South Africa. Analysis was performed using over 900 000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms in 20 unrelated ancestry-informative marker selected Coloured individuals and made comparisons with historically predicted founder populations. We show that there is substantial genetic contribution from at least four distinct population groups: Europeans, South {A}sians, Indonesians and a population genetically close to the isiXhosa sub-Saharan Bantu. This is in good accord with the historical record. We briefly examine the implications of determining the genetic diversity of this population, not only for furthering understanding of human evolution out of Africa, but also for genome-wide association studies using admixture mapping. In conclusion, we define the genetic structure of a uniquely admixed population that holds great potential to advance genetic-based medical research.},

	Abstract = {Admixed populations present unique opportunities to discover the genetic factors underlying many multifactorial diseases. The geographical position and complex history of South Africa has led to the establishment of the unique admixed population known as the South African Coloured. Not much is known about the genetic make-up of this population, and the historical record is patchy. We genotyped 959 individuals from the Western Cape area, self-identified as belonging to this population, using the Affymetrix 500k genotyping platform. This resulted in nearly 75,000 autosomal {SNP}s that could be compared with populations represented in the International HapMap Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project. Analysis by means of both the admixture and linkage models in STRUCTURE revealed that the major ancestral components of this population are predominantly Khoesan (32-43\%), Bantu-speaking Africans (20-36\%), European (21-28\%) and a smaller {A}sian contribution (9-11\%), depending on the model used. This is consistent with historical data. While of great historical and genealogical interest, this information is also essential for future admixture mapping of disease genes in this population.},

	Abstract = {Mexico is developing the basis for genomic medicine to improve healthcare of its population. The extensive study of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium structure of different populations has made it possible to develop tagging and imputation strategies to comprehensively analyze common genetic variation in association studies of complex diseases. We assessed the benefit of a {M}exican haplotype map to improve identification of genes related to common diseases in the {M}exican population. We evaluated genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and extent of haplotype sharing using genomewide data from {M}exican {M}estizos from regions with different histories of admixture and particular population dynamics. Ancestry was evaluated by including 1 {M}exican Amerindian group and data from the HapMap. Our results provide evidence of genetic differences between {M}exican subpopulations that should be considered in the design and analysis of association studies of complex diseases. In addition, these results support the notion that a haplotype map of the {M}exican {M}estizo population can reduce the number of tag {SNP}s required to characterize common genetic variation in this population.

	Abstract = {Although high-density {SNP} genotyping platforms generate a momentum for detailed genome-wide association (GWA) studies, an offshoot is a new insight into population genetics. Here, we present an example in one of the best-known founder populations by scrutinizing ten distinct Finnish early- and late-settlement subpopulations. By determining genetic distances, homozygosity, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium, we demonstrate that population substructure, and even individual ancestry, is detectable at a very high resolution and supports the concept of multiple historical bottlenecks resulting from consecutive founder effects. Given that genetic studies are currently aiming at identifying smaller and smaller genetic effects, recognizing and controlling for population substructure even at this fine level becomes imperative to avoid confounding and spurious associations. This study provides an example of the power of GWA data sets to demonstrate stratification caused by population history even within a seemingly homogeneous population, like the Finns. Further, the results provide interesting lessons concerning the impact of population history on the genome landscape of humans, as well as approaches to identify rare variants enriched in these subpopulations.},

	Abstract = {Using principal component (PC) analysis, we studied the genetic constitution of 3,112 individuals from Europe as portrayed by more than 270,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s) genotyped with the Illumina Infinium platform. In cohorts where the sample size was >100, one hundred randomly chosen samples were used for analysis to minimize the sample size effect, resulting in a total of 1,564 samples. This analysis revealed that the genetic structure of the European population correlates closely with geography. The first two PCs highlight the genetic diversity corresponding to the northwest to southeast gradient and position the populations according to their approximate geographic origin. The resulting genetic map forms a triangular structure with a) Finland, b) the Baltic region, Poland and Western Russia, and c) Italy as its vertexes, and with d) Central- and Western Europe in its centre. Inter- and intra- population genetic differences were quantified by the inflation factor lambda (lambda) (ranging from 1.00 to 4.21), fixation index (F(st)) (ranging from 0.000 to 0.023), and by the number of markers exhibiting significant allele frequency differences in pair-wise population comparisons. The estimated lambda was used to assess the real diminishing impact to association statistics when two distinct populations are merged directly in an analysis. When the PC analysis was confined to the 1,019 Estonian individuals (0.1\% of the Estonian population), a fine structure emerged that correlated with the geography of individual counties. With at least two cohorts available from several countries, genetic substructures were investigated in Czech, Finnish, German, Estonian and Italian populations. Together with previously published data, our results allow the creation of a comprehensive European genetic map that will greatly facilitate inter-population genetic studies including genome wide association studies (GWAS).},

	Abstract = {Molecular Anthropology is a relatively young field of research. In fact, less than 50 years have passed since the symposium "Classification and Human Evolution" (1962, Burg Wartenstein, Austria), where the term was formally introduced by Emil Zuckerkandl. In this time, Molecular Anthropology has developed both methodologically and theoretically and extended its applications, so covering key aspects of human evolution such as the reconstruction of the history of human populations and peopling processes, the characterization of DNA in extinct humans and the role of adaptive processes in shaping the genetic diversity of our species. In the current scientific panorama, molecular anthropologists have to face a double challenge. As members of the anthropological community, we are strongly committed to the integration of biological findings and other lines of evidence (e.g. linguistic and archaeological), while keeping in line with methodological innovations which are moving the approach from the genetic to the genomic level. In this framework, the meeting "DNA Polymorphisms in Human Populations: Molecular Anthropology in the Genomic Era" (Rome, December 3-5, 2009) offered an opportunity for discussion among scholars from different disciplines, while paying attention to the impact of recent methodological innovations. Here we present an overview of the meeting and discuss perspectives and prospects of Molecular Anthropology in the genomic era.},

A second PC further separated Italian, Spanish, and Greek individuals from those of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry as well as distinguishing among northern European populations. In separate analyses of northern European participants other substructure relationships were discerned showing a west to east gradient. Application of this substructure information was critical in examining a real dataset in whole genome association (WGA) analyses for rheumatoid arthritis in European Americans to reduce false positive signals. In addition, two sets of European substructure ancestry informative markers (ESAIMs) were identified that provide substantial substructure information. The results provide further insight into European population genetic substructure and show that this information can be used for improving error rates in association testing of candidate genes and in replication studies of WGA scans.},

	Abstract = {We consider the statistical analysis of population structure using genetic data. We show how the two most widely used approaches to modeling population structure, admixture-based models and principal components analysis (PCA), can be viewed within a single unifying framework of matrix factorization. Specifically, they can both be interpreted as approximating an observed genotype matrix by a product of two lower-rank matrices, but with different constraints or prior distributions on these lower-rank matrices. This opens the door to a large range of possible approaches to analyzing population structure, by considering other constraints or priors. In this paper, we introduce one such novel approach, based on sparse factor analysis (SFA). We investigate the effects of the different types of constraint in several real and simulated data sets. We find that SFA produces similar results to admixture-based models when the samples are descended from a few well-differentiated ancestral populations and can recapitulate the results of PCA when the population structure is more "continuous," as in isolation-by-distance models.},

	Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

	Abstract = {Nearly 30 years ago, Cavalli-Sforza et al. pioneered the use of principal component analysis (PCA) in population genetics and used PCA to produce maps summarizing human genetic variation across continental regions. They interpreted gradient and wave patterns in these maps as signatures of specific migration events. These interpretations have been controversial, but influential, and the use of PCA has become widespread in analysis of population genetics data. However, the behavior of PCA for genetic data showing continuous spatial variation, such as might exist within human continental groups, has been less well characterized. Here, we find that gradients and waves observed in Cavalli-Sforza et al.'s maps resemble sinusoidal mathematical artifacts that arise generally when PCA is applied to spatial data, implying that the patterns do not necessarily reflect specific migration events. Our findings aid interpretation of PCA results and suggest how PCA can help correct for continuous population structure in association studies.},

	Abstract = {European Americans are often treated as a homogeneous group, but in fact form a structured population due to historical immigration of diverse source populations. Discerning the ancestry of European Americans genotyped in association studies is important in order to prevent false-positive or false-negative associations due to population stratification and to identify genetic variants whose contribution to disease risk differs across European ancestries. Here, we investigate empirical patterns of population structure in European Americans, analyzing 4,198 samples from four genome-wide association studies to show that components roughly corresponding to northwest European, southeast European, and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are the main sources of European American population structure. Building on this insight, we constructed a panel of 300 validated markers that are highly informative for distinguishing these ancestries. We demonstrate that this panel of markers can be used to correct for stratification in association studies that do not generate dense genotype data.},

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations.

We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

@article{Alexander:2009ij,
	Abstract = {Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.},

	Abstract = {The genome of an admixed individual represents a mixture of alleles from different ancestries. In the United States, the two largest minority groups, African-Americans and Hispanics, are both admixed. An understanding of the admixture proportion at an individual level (individual admixture, or IA) is valuable for both population geneticists and epidemiologists who conduct case-control association studies in these groups. Here we present an extension of a previously described frequentist (maximum likelihood or ML) approach to estimate individual admixture that allows for uncertainty in ancestral allele frequencies. We compare this approach both to prior partial likelihood based methods as well as more recently described Bayesian MCMC methods. Our full ML method demonstrates increased robustness when compared to an existing partial ML approach. Simulations also suggest that this frequentist estimator achieves similar efficiency, measured by the mean squared error criterion, as Bayesian methods but requires just a fraction of the computational time to produce point estimates, allowing for extensive analysis (e.g., simulations) not possible by Bayesian methods. Our simulation results demonstrate that inclusion of ancestral populations or their surrogates in the analysis is required by any method of IA estimation to obtain reasonable results.},

To provide formal tests of these qualitative observations, we describe a Procrustes analysis approach for quantitatively assessing the similarity of population-genetic and geographic maps. We confirm in two scenarios, one using single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) data from Europe and one using {SNP} data worldwide, that a measurably high level of concordance exists between statistical maps of population-genetic variation and geographic maps of sampling locations. Two other examples illustrate the versatility of the Procrustes approach in population-genetic applications, verifying the concordance of {SNP} analyses using PCA and MDS, and showing that statistical maps of worldwide copy-number variants (CNVs) accord with statistical maps of {SNP} variation, especially when CNV analysis is limited to samples with the highest-quality data. As statistical maps with PCA and MDS have become increasingly common for use in summarizing population relationships, our examples highlight the potential of Procrustes-based quantitative comparisons for interpreting the results in these maps.},

	Abstract = {The spatial distribution of genetic markers can be useful both in estimating patterns of gene flow and in reconstructing biogeographic history, particularly when gene genealogies can be estimated. Genealogies based on nonrecombining genetic units such as mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA often consist of geographically separated clades that come into contact in narrow regions. Such phylogeographic breaks are usually assumed to be the result of long-term barriers to gene flow. Here I show that deep phylogeographic breaks can form within a continuously distributed species even when there are no barriers to gene flow. The likelihood of observing phylogeographic breaks increases as the average individual dispersal distance and population size decrease. Those molecular markers that are most likely to show evidence of real geographic barriers are also most likely to show phylogeographic breaks that formed without any barrier to gene flow. These results might provide an explanation as to why some species, such as the greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides), have phylogeographic breaks in mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA that do not coincide with sudden changes in other traits.},

The two populations are assumed to be descended from a panmictic ancestral population at some time in the past and may (or may not) after that be connected by migration. The use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo method allows the joint estimation of multiple demographic parameters in either a Bayesian or a likelihood framework. The parameters estimated include the migration rate for each population, the time since the two populations diverged from a common ancestral population, and the relative size of each of the two current populations and of the common ancestral population. The results show that even a single nonrecombining genetic locus can provide substantial power to test the hypothesis of no ongoing migration and/or to test models of symmetric migration between the two populations. The use of the method is illustrated in an application to mitochondrial DNA sequence data from a fish species: the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus).},

Although not analytically solvable, several approaches, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, have been developed to find approximate solutions. Here, we describe an approach in which Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations are used to integrate over the space of genealogies, whereas other parameters are integrated out analytically. The result is an approximation to the full joint posterior density of the model parameters. For many purposes, this function can be treated as a likelihood, thereby permitting likelihood-based analyses, including likelihood ratio tests of nested models. Several examples, including an application to the divergence of chimpanzee subspecies, are provided.},

	Abstract = {The genetic study of diverging, closely related populations is required for basic questions on demography and speciation, as well as for biodiversity and conservation research. However, it is often unclear whether divergence is due simply to separation or whether populations have also experienced gene flow. These questions can be addressed with a full model of population separation with gene flow, by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating the posterior probability distribution of model parameters. We have generalized this method and made it applicable to data from multiple unlinked loci. These loci can vary in their modes of inheritance, and inheritance scalars can be implemented either as constants or as parameters to be estimated. By treating inheritance scalars as parameters it is also possible to address variation among loci in the impact via linkage of recurrent selective sweeps or background selection. These methods are applied to a large multilocus data set from Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The species are estimated to have diverged approximately 500,000 years ago. Several loci have nonzero estimates of gene flow since the initial separation of the species, with considerable variation in gene flow estimates among loci, in both directions between the species.},

	Abstract = {Most methods for studying divergence with gene flow rely upon data from many individuals at few loci. Such data can be useful for inferring recent population history but they are unlikely to contain sufficient information about older events. However, the growing availability of genome sequences suggests a different kind of sampling scheme, one that may be more suited to studying relatively ancient divergence. Data sets extracted from whole-genome alignments may represent very few individuals but contain a very large number of loci. To take advantage of such data we developed a new maximum-likelihood method for genomic data under the isolation-with-migration model. Unlike many coalescent-based likelihood methods, our method does not rely on Monte Carlo sampling of genealogies, but rather provides a precise calculation of the likelihood by numerical integration over all genealogies. We demonstrate that the method works well on simulated data sets. We also consider two models for accommodating mutation rate variation among loci and find that the model that treats mutation rates as random variables leads to better estimates. We applied the method to the divergence of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans and detected a low, but statistically significant, signal of gene flow from D. simulans to D. melanogaster.},

Necessarily, processes associated with older time periods in a phylogeny are more difficult to estimate; and histories with high levels of gene flow are particularly difficult with more than two populations.

	Abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) data can be used for parameter estimation via maximum likelihood methods as long as the way in which the {SNP}s were determined is known, so that an appropriate likelihood formula can be constructed. We present such likelihoods for several sampling methods. As a test of these approaches, we consider use of {SNP}s to estimate the parameter Theta = 4N(e)micro (the scaled product of effective population size and per-site mutation rate), which is related to the branch lengths of the reconstructed genealogy. With infinite amounts of data, ML models using {SNP} data are expected to produce consistent estimates of Theta. With finite amounts of data the estimates are accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased upward when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not allowed for in the analysis, the results are additionally biased upward, but this effect can be removed by incorporating recombination into the analysis. {SNP}s defined as sites that are polymorphic in the actual sample under consideration (sample {SNP}s) are somewhat more accurate for estimation of Theta than {SNP}s defined by their polymorphism in a panel chosen from the same population (panel {SNP}s). Misrepresenting panel {SNP}s as sample {SNP}s leads to large errors in the maximum likelihood estimate of Theta. Researchers collecting {SNP}s should collect and preserve information about the method of ascertainment so that the data can be accurately analyzed.},

	Abstract = {How populations diverge and give rise to distinct species remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology, with important implications for a wide range of fields, from conservation genetics to human evolution. A promising approach is to estimate parameters of simple speciation models using polymorphism data from multiple loci. Existing methods, however, make a number of assumptions that severely limit their applicability, notably, no gene flow after the populations split and no intralocus recombination. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate parameters of an isolation-migration model. The approach uses summaries of polymorphism data at multiple loci surveyed in a pair of diverging populations or closely related species and, importantly, allows for intralocus recombination. To illustrate its potential, we applied it to extensive polymorphism data from populations and species of apes, whose demographic histories are largely unknown. The isolation-migration model appears to provide a reasonable fit to the data. It suggests that the two chimpanzee species became reproductively isolated in allopatry approximately 850 Kya, while Western and Central chimpanzee populations split approximately 440 Kya but continued to exchange migrants. Similarly, Eastern and Western gorillas and Sumatran and Bornean orangutans appear to have experienced gene flow since their splits approximately 90 and over 250 Kya, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Two commonly used measures of genetic diversity for intraspecies DNA sequence data are based, respectively, on the number of segregating sites, and on the average number of pairwise nucleotide differences. Expressions are derived for their variance in the presence of intragenic recombination for a panmictic population of fixed size that is at neutral equilibrium at the region sequenced. We show that, in contrast to the slow decrease in variance with increasing sample size, if the recombination rate is nonzero, the asymptotic rate of decrease of variance with increasing sequence length, for fixed sample size, is quite rapid. In particular, it is close to that which would be obtained by sequencing independent chromosome regions. The correlation between measures of diversity from linked regions is also examined. For a given total number of bases sequenced in a particular region, optimal sequencing strategies are derived. These typically involve sequencing relatively few (three to 10) long copies of the region. Under optimal strategies, the variances of the two measures are very similar for most parameter values considered. Results concerning optimal sequencing strategies will be sensitive to gross departures from the underlying assumptions, such as population bottlenecks, selective sweeps, and substantial population substructure.},

Our results are consistent with the consensus view of a single "Out-of-Africa" bottleneck and serial dilution of diversity during global colonization, including a prominent East {A}sian bottleneck. They also suggest novel details including: (1) the most northerly East {A}sian population in the sample (Yakut) has received a significant genetic contribution from the ancestors of the most northerly European one (Orcadian). (2) Native North [corrected] Americans have received ancestry from a source closely related to modern North-East {A}sians (Mongolians and Oroquen) that is distinct from the sources for native South [corrected] Americans, implying multiple waves of migration into the Americas.

	Abstract = {Hispanic/Latino populations possess a complex genetic structure that reflects recent admixture among and potentially ancient substructure within Native American, European, and West African source populations. Here, we quantify genome-wide patterns of {SNP} and haplotype variation among 100 individuals with ancestry from Ecuador, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic genotyped on the Illumina 610-Quad arrays and 112 {M}exicans genotyped on Affymetrix 500K platform. Intersecting these data with previously collected high-density {SNP} data from 4,305 individuals, we use principal component analysis and clustering methods FRAPPE and STRUCTURE to investigate genome-wide patterns of African, European, and Native American population structure within and among Hispanic/Latino populations. Comparing autosomal, {X} and Y chromosome, and mtDNA variation, we find evidence of a significant sex bias in admixture proportions consistent with disproportionate contribution of European male and Native American female ancestry to present-day populations. We also find that patterns of linkage-disequilibria in admixed Hispanic/Latino populations are largely affected by the admixture dynamics of the populations, with faster decay of LD in populations of higher African ancestry. Finally, using the locus-specific ancestry inference method LAMP, we reconstruct fine-scale chromosomal patterns of admixture. We document moderate power to differentiate among potential subcontinental source populations within the Native American, European, and African segments of the admixed Hispanic/Latino genomes. Our results suggest future genome-wide association scans in Hispanic/Latino populations may require correction for local genomic ancestry at a subcontinental scale when associating differences in the genome with disease risk, progression, and drug efficacy, as well as for admixture mapping.},

	Abstract = {The Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population has long been viewed as a genetic isolate, yet it is still unclear how population bottlenecks, admixture, or positive selection contribute to its genetic structure. Here we analyzed a large AJ cohort and found higher linkage disequilibrium (LD) and identity-by-descent relative to Europeans, as expected for an isolate. However, paradoxically we also found higher genetic diversity, a sign of an older or more admixed population but not of a long-term isolate. Recent reports have reaffirmed that the AJ population has a common Middle Eastern origin with other Jewish Diaspora populations, but also suggest that the AJ population, compared with other Jews, has had the most European admixture. Our analysis indeed revealed higher European admixture than predicted from previous Y-chromosome analyses. Moreover, we also show that admixture directly correlates with high LD, suggesting that admixture has increased both genetic diversity and LD in the AJ population. Additionally, we applied extended haplotype tests to determine whether positive selection can account for the level of AJ-prevalent diseases. We identified genomic regions under selection that account for lactose and alcohol tolerance, and although we found evidence for positive selection at some AJ-prevalent disease loci, the higher incidence of the majority of these diseases is likely the result of genetic drift following a bottleneck. Thus, the AJ population shows evidence of past founding events; however, admixture and selection have also strongly influenced its current genetic makeup.},

	Abstract = {Contemporary Jews comprise an aggregate of ethno-religious communities whose worldwide members identify with each other through various shared religious, historical and cultural traditions. Historical evidence suggests common origins in the Middle East, followed by migrations leading to the establishment of communities of Jews in Europe, Africa and Asia, in what is termed the Jewish Diaspora. This complex demographic history imposes special challenges in attempting to address the genetic structure of the Jewish people. Although many genetic studies have shed light on Jewish origins and on diseases prevalent among Jewish communities, including studies focusing on uniparentally and biparentally inherited markers, genome-wide patterns of variation across the vast geographic span of Jewish Diaspora communities and their respective neighbours have yet to be addressed. Here we use high-density bead arrays to genotype individuals from 14 Jewish Diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genome-wide diversity with those from 69 Old World non-Jewish populations, of which 25 have not previously been reported. These samples were carefully chosen to provide comprehensive comparisons between Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the Diaspora, as well as with non-Jewish populations from the Middle East and north Africa. Principal component and structure-like analyses identify previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the Middle East. Most Jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster that overlies Druze and Cypriot samples but not samples from other Levantine populations or paired Diaspora host populations. In contrast, Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) and Indian Jews (Bene Israel and Cochini) cluster with neighbouring autochthonous populations in Ethiopia and western India, respectively, despite a clear paternal link between the Bene Israel and the Levant. These results cast light on the variegated genetic architecture of the Middle East, and trace the origins of most Jewish Diaspora communities to the Levant.},

	Abstract = {For more than a century, Jews and non-Jews alike have tried to define the relatedness of contemporary Jewish people. Previous genetic studies of blood group and serum markers suggested that Jewish groups had Middle Eastern origin with greater genetic similarity between paired Jewish populations. However, these and successor studies of monoallelic Y chromosomal and mitochondrial genetic markers did not resolve the issues of within and between-group Jewish genetic identity. Here, genome-wide analysis of seven Jewish groups (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek, and Ashkenazi) and comparison with non-Jewish groups demonstrated distinctive Jewish population clusters, each with shared Middle Eastern ancestry, proximity to contemporary Middle Eastern populations, and variable degrees of European and North African admixture. Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry. Rapid decay of IBD in Ashkenazi Jewish genomes was consistent with a severe bottleneck followed by large expansion, such as occurred with the so-called demographic miracle of population expansion from 50,000 people at the beginning of the 15th century to 5,000,000 people at the beginning of the 19th century. Thus, this study demonstrates that European/Syrian and Middle Eastern Jews represent a series of geographical isolates or clusters woven together by shared IBD genetic threads.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well known that the pattern of linkage disequilibrium varies between human populations, with remarkable geographical stratification. Indirect association studies routinely exploit linkage disequilibrium around genes, particularly in isolated populations where it is assumed to be higher. Here, we explore both the amount and the decay of linkage disequilibrium with physical distance along 211 gene regions, most of them related to complex diseases, across 39 HGDP-CEPH population samples, focusing particularly on the populations defined as isolates. Within each gene region and population we use r2 between all possible single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) pairs as a measure of linkage disequilibrium and focus on the proportion of {SNP} pairs with r2 greater than 0.8. RESULTS: Although the average r2 was found to be significantly different both between and within continental regions, a much higher proportion of r2 variance could be attributed to differences between continental regions (2.8\% vs. 0.5\%, respectively). Similarly, while the proportion of {SNP} pairs with r2 > 0.8 was significantly different across continents for all distance classes, it was generally much more homogenous within continents, except in the case of Africa and the Americas. The only isolated populations with consistently higher LD in all distance classes with respect to their continent are the Kalash (Central South Asia) and the Surui (America). Moreover, isolated populations showed only slightly higher proportions of {SNP} pairs with r2 > 0.8 per gene region than non-isolated populations in the same continent. Thus, the number of {SNP}s in isolated populations that need to be genotyped may be only slightly less than in non-isolates. CONCLUSION: The "isolated population" label by itself does not guarantee a greater genotyping efficiency in association studies, and properties other than increased linkage disequilibrium may make these populations interesting in genetic epidemiology.},

We found that F (ST) distances between Spanish Basques and other populations were similar to those between pairs of non-Basque populations. The same result is found in a PCA of individuals, showing a general distinction between Iberians and other South Europeans independently of being Basques. Pathogen-mediated natural selection may be responsible for the high differentiation previously reported for Basques at very specific genes such as ABO, RH, and HLA.

Furthermore, analyses of nucleotide positions in the mitochondrial control region that evolve slowly show a decrease in genetic diversity in Finns. Thus, relatively few men and women have contributed the genetic lineages that today survive in the Finnish population. This is likely to have caused the so-called "Finnish disease heritage"-i.e., the occurrence of several genetic diseases in the Finnish population that are rare elsewhere. A preliminary analysis of the mitochondrial mutations that have accumulated subsequent to the bottleneck suggests that it occurred about 4000 years ago, presumably when populations using agriculture and animal husbandry arrived in Finland.},

	Abstract = {Population structure can provide novel insight into the human past, and recognizing and correcting for such stratification is a practical concern in gene mapping by many association methodologies. We investigate these patterns, primarily through principal component (PC) analysis of whole genome {SNP} polymorphism, in 2099 individuals from populations of Northern European origin (Ireland, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and HapMap European-American). The major trends (PC1 and PC2) demonstrate an ability to detect geographic substructure, even over a small area like the British Isles, and this information can then be applied to finely dissect the ancestry of the European-Australian and European-American samples. They simultaneously point to the importance of considering population stratification in what might be considered a small homogeneous region. There is evidence from F(ST)-based analysis of genic and nongenic {SNP}s that differential positive selection has operated across these populations despite their short divergence time and relatively similar geographic and environmental range. The pressure appears to have been focused on genes involved in immunity, perhaps reflecting response to infectious disease epidemic. Such an event may explain a striking selective sweep centered on the rs2508049-G allele, close to the HLA-G gene on chromosome 6. Evidence of the sweep extends over a 8-Mb/3.5-cM region. Overall, the results illustrate the power of dense genotype and sample data to explore regional population variation, the events that have crafted it, and their implications in both explaining disease prevalence and mapping these genes by association.},

We report GWAS results for nine quantitative metabolic traits (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, body mass index, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966), drawn from the most genetically isolated Finnish regions. We replicate most previously reported associations for these traits and identify nine new associations, several of which highlight genes with metabolic functions: high-density lipoprotein with NR1H3 (LXRA), low-density lipoprotein with AR and FADS1-FADS2, glucose with MTNR1B, and insulin with PANK1. Two of these new associations emerged after adjustment of results for body mass index. Gene-environment interaction analyses suggested additional associations, which will require validation in larger samples. The currently identified loci, together with quantified environmental exposures, explain little of the trait variation in NFBC1966. The association observed between low-density lipoprotein and an infrequent variant in AR suggests the potential of such a cohort for identifying associations with both common, low-impact and rarer, high-impact quantitative trait loci.},

Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy-often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

Previous work using 40 microsatellites showed that the Icelandic population is relatively homogeneous, but exhibits subtle population structure that can bias disease association statistics. Here, we show that regional geographic ancestries of individuals from Iceland can be distinguished using 292,289 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s). We further show that subpopulation differences are due to genetic drift since the settlement of Iceland 1100 years ago, and not to varying contributions from different ancestral populations. A consequence of the recent origin of Icelandic population structure is that allele frequency differences follow a null distribution devoid of outliers, so that the risk of false positive associations due to stratification is minimal. Our results highlight an important distinction between population differences attributable to recent drift and those arising from more ancient divergence, which has implications both for association studies and for efforts to detect natural selection using population differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the genetic structure of the European population is important, not only from a historical perspective, but also for the appropriate design and interpretation of genetic epidemiological studies. Previous population genetic analyses with autosomal markers in Europe either had a wide geographic but narrow genomic coverage [1, 2], or vice versa [3-6]. We therefore investigated Affymetrix GeneChip 500K genotype data from 2,514 individuals belonging to 23 different subpopulations, widely spread over Europe. Although we found only a low level of genetic differentiation between subpopulations, the existing differences were characterized by a strong continent-wide correlation between geographic and genetic distance. Furthermore, mean heterozygosity was larger, and mean linkage disequilibrium smaller, in southern as compared to northern Europe. Both parameters clearly showed a clinal distribution that provided evidence for a spatial continuity of genetic diversity in Europe. Our comprehensive genetic data are thus compatible with expectations based upon European population history, including the hypotheses of a south-north expansion and/or a larger effective population size in southern than in northern Europe. By including the widely used CEPH from Utah (CEU) samples into our analysis, we could show that these individuals represent northern and western Europeans reasonably well, thereby confirming their assumed regional ancestry.},

In this review, we summarize data on patterns of human genetic diversity and the evolutionary forces (mutation, genetic drift, migration, and selection) that have shaped these patterns of variation across both human populations and the genome. African population samples typically have higher levels of genetic diversity, a complex population substructure, and low levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) relative to non-African populations.

	Abstract = {Studies of large sets of single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) data have proven to be a powerful tool in the analysis of the genetic structure of human populations. In this work, we analyze genotyping data for 2841 {SNP}s in 12 sub-Saharan African populations, including a previously unsampled region of southeastern Africa (Mozambique). We show that robust results in a world-wide perspective can be obtained when analyzing only 1000 {SNP}s. Our main results both confirm the results of previous studies, and show new and interesting features in sub-Saharan African genetic complexity. There is a strong differentiation of Nilo-Saharans, much beyond what would be expected by geography. Hunter-gatherer populations (Khoisan and Pygmies) show a clear distinctiveness with very intrinsic Pygmy (and not only Khoisan) genetic features. Populations of the West Africa present an unexpected similarity among them, possibly the result of a population expansion. Finally, we find a strong differentiation of the southeastern Bantu population from Mozambique, which suggests an assimilation of a pre-Bantu substrate by Bantu speakers in the region.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 25 August 2010; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2010.141.},

	Abstract = {Technological and scientific advances, stemming in large part from the Human Genome and HapMap projects, have made large-scale, genome-wide investigations feasible and cost effective. These advances have the potential to dramatically impact drug discovery and development by identifying genetic factors that contribute to variation in disease risk as well as drug pharmacokinetics, treatment efficacy, and adverse drug reactions. In spite of the technological advancements, successful application in biomedical research would be limited without access to suitable sample collections. To facilitate exploratory genetics research, we have assembled a DNA resource from a large number of subjects participating in multiple studies throughout the world. This growing resource was initially genotyped with a commercially available genome-wide 500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism panel. This project includes nearly 6,000 subjects of African-American, East {A}sian, South {A}sian, {M}exican, and European origin. Seven informative axes of variation identified via principal-component analysis (PCA) of these data confirm the overall integrity of the data and highlight important features of the genetic structure of diverse populations. The potential value of such extensively genotyped collections is illustrated by selection of genetically matched population controls in a genome-wide analysis of abacavir-associated hypersensitivity reaction. We find that matching based on country of origin, identity-by-state distance, and multidimensional PCA do similarly well to control the type I error rate. The genotype and demographic data from this reference sample are freely available through the NCBI database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).},

Here I try to give a short summary of the evolution of modern humans, a unique species in many respects but of special interest to readers of this volume, and a few thoughts on the general rates of evolution that might be relevant to medical genetics and genetic epidemiology.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We reasoned that by identifying genetic markers on human {X} chromosome regions where recombination is rare or absent, we should be able to construct {X} chromosome genealogies analogous to those based on Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms, with the advantage of providing information about both male and female components of the population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified a 47 Kb interval containing an Alu insertion polymorphism (DXS225) and four microsatellites in complete linkage disequilibrium in a low recombination rate region of the long arm of the human {X} chromosome. This haplotype block was studied in 667 males from the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel. The haplotypic diversity was highest in Africa (0.992+/-0.0025) and lowest in the Americas (0.839+/-0.0378), where no insertion alleles of DXS225 were observed. Africa shared few haplotypes with other geographical areas, while those exhibited significant sharing among themselves. Median joining networks revealed that the African haplotypes were numerous, occupied the periphery of the graph and had low frequency, whereas those from the other continents were few, central and had high frequency. Altogether, our data support a single origin of modern man in Africa and migration to occupy the other continents by serial founder effects. Coalescent analysis permitted estimation of the time of the most recent common ancestor as 182,000 years (56,700-479,000) and the estimated time of the DXS225 Alu insertion of 94,400 years (24,300-310,000). These dates are fully compatible with the current widely accepted scenario of the origin of modern mankind in Africa within the last 195,000 years and migration out-of-Africa circa 55,000-65,000 years ago. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A haplotypic block combining an Alu insertion polymorphism and four microsatellite markers on the human {X} chromosome is a useful marker to evaluate genetic diversity of human populations and provides a highly informative tool for evolutionary studies.},

	Abstract = {The population genetic history of a 10.1-kbp noncoding region of the human {X} chromosome was studied using the males of the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel (672 individuals from 52 populations). The geographic distribution of patterns of variation was roughly consistent with previous studies, with the major exception that 1 highly divergent haplotype (haplotype X, hX) was observed at low frequency in widely scattered non-African populations and not at all observed in sub-Saharan African populations. Microsatellite (short tandem repeat) variation within the sequenced region was low among copies of hX, even though the estimated time of ancestry of hX and other sequences was 1.44 Myr. The estimated age of the common ancestor of all hX copies was 5,230 years (95% consistency index: 2,000-75,480 years). To further address the presence of hX in Africa, additional samples from Chad and Tanzania were screened. Five additional copies of hX were observed, consistent with a history in which hX was present in Africa prior to the migration of modern humans out of Africa and with eastern Africa being the source of non-African modern human populations. Taken together, these features of hX-that it is much older than other haplotypes and uncommon and patchily distributed throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia-present a cautionary tale for interpretations of human history.},

	Abstract = {When performing association studies in populations that have not been the focus of large-scale investigations of haplotype variation, it is often helpful to rely on genomic databases in other populations for study design and analysis - such as in the selection of tag {SNP}s and in the imputation of missing genotypes. One way of improving the use of these databases is to rely on a mixture of database samples that is similar to the population of interest, rather than using the single most similar database sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the mixture approach in the application of African, European, and East {A}sian HapMap samples for tag {SNP} selection in populations from India, a genetically intermediate region underrepresented in genomic studies of haplotype variation.},

	Abstract = {Located off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, Britain and Ireland were among the last regions of Europe to be colonized by modern humans after the last glacial maximum. Further, the geographical location of Britain, and in particular of Ireland, is such that the impact of historical migration has been minimal. Genetic diversity studies applying the Y chromosome and mitochondrial systems have indicated reduced diversity and an increased population structure across Britain and Ireland relative to the European mainland. Such characteristics would have implications for genetic mapping studies of complex disease. We set out to further our understanding of the genetic architecture of the region from the perspective of (i) population structure, (ii) linkage disequilibrium (LD), (iii) homozygosity and (iv) haplotype diversity (HD). Analysis was conducted on 3654 individuals from Ireland, Britain (with regional sampling in Scotland), Bulgaria, Portugal, Sweden and the Utah HapMap collection. Our results indicate a subtle but clear genetic structure across Britain and Ireland, although levels of structure were reduced in comparison with average cross-European structure. We observed slightly elevated levels of LD and homozygosity in the Irish population compared with neighbouring European populations. We also report on a cline of HD across Europe with greatest levels in southern populations and lowest levels in Ireland and Scotland. These results are consistent with our understanding of the population history of Europe and promote Ireland and Scotland as relatively homogenous resources for genetic mapping of rare variants.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most recent Alu insertions reveal different degrees of polymorphism in human populations, and a series of characteristics that make them particularly suitable genetic markers for Human Biology studies. This has led these polymorphisms to be used to analyse the origin and phylogenetic relationships between contemporary human groups. This study analyses twelve Alu sequences in a sample of 216 individuals from the autochthonous population of Galicia (NW Spain), with the aim of studying their genetic structure and phylogenetic position with respect to the populations of Western and Central Europe and North Africa, research that is of special interest in revealing European population dynamics, given the peculiarities of the Galician population due to its geographical situation in western Europe, and its historical vicissitudes. RESULTS: The insertion frequencies of eleven of the Alu elements analysed were within the variability range of European populations, while Yb8NBC125 proved to be the lowest so far recorded to date in Europe. Taking the twelve polymorphisms into account, the GD value for the Galician population was 0.268. The comparative analyses carried out using the MDS, NJ and AMOVA methods reveal the existence of spatial heterogeneity, and identify three population groups that correspond to the geographic areas of Western-Central Europe, Eastern Mediterranean Europe and North Africa. Galicia is shown to be included in the Western-Central European cluster, together with other Spanish populations. When only considering populations from Mediterranean Europe, the Galician population revealed a degree of genetic flow similar to that of the majority of the populations from this geographic area. CONCLUSION: The results of this study reveal that the Galician population, despite its geographic situation in the western edge of the European continent, occupies an intermediate position in relation to other European populations in general, and Iberian populations in particular. This confirms the important role that migratory movements have had in the European gene pool, at least since Neolithic times. In turn, the MDS and NJ analyses place Galicia within the group comprised of Western-Central European populations, which is justified by the influence of Germanic peoples on the Galician population during the Middle Ages. However, it should also be noted that some of the markers analysed have a certain degree of differentiation, possibly due to the region's position as a 'cul-de-sac' in terms of Iberian population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {We examined genetic diversity and population structure in the American landmass using 678 autosomal microsatellite markers genotyped in 422 individuals representing 24 Native American populations sampled from North, Central, and South America. These data were analyzed jointly with similar data available in 54 other indigenous populations worldwide, including an additional five Native American groups. The Native American populations have lower genetic diversity and greater differentiation than populations from other continental regions. We observe gradients both of decreasing genetic diversity as a function of geographic distance from the Bering Strait and of decreasing genetic similarity to Siberians--signals of the southward dispersal of human populations from the northwestern tip of the Americas. We also observe evidence of: (1) a higher level of diversity and lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America, (2) a relative lack of differentiation between Mesoamerican and Andean populations, (3) a scenario in which coastal routes were easier for migrating peoples to traverse in comparison with inland routes, and (4) a partial agreement on a local scale between genetic similarity and the linguistic classification of populations. These findings offer new insights into the process of population dispersal and differentiation during the peopling of the Americas.},

	Abstract = {Phenotypic traits have been used for centuries for the purpose of racial classification. Developments in quantitative population genetics have allowed global comparison of patterns of phenotypic variation with patterns of variation in classical genetic markers and DNA markers. Human skin color shows a high degree of variation among geographic regions, typical of traits that show extensive natural selection. Even given this high level of geographic differentiation, skin color variation is clinal and is not well described by discrete racial categories. Craniometric traits show a level of among-region differentiation comparable to genetic markers, with high levels of variation within populations as well as a correlation between phenotypic and geographic distance. Craniometric variation is geographically structured, allowing high levels of classification accuracy when comparing crania from different parts of the world. Nonetheless, the boundaries in global variation are not abrupt and do not fit a strict view of the race concept; the number of races and the cutoffs used to define them are arbitrary. The race concept is at best a crude first-order approximation to the geographically structured phenotypic variation in the human species. Am J Phys Anthropol 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {The human history of Oceania is unique in the way that it encompasses both the first out-of-Africa expansion of modern humans to New Guinea and Australia as well as the last regional human occupation of Polynesia. Other anthropological peculiarities of Oceania include features like the extraordinarily rich linguistic diversity especially of New Guinea with about 1,000 often very distinct languages, the independent and early development of agriculture in the highlands of New Guinea about 10,000 years ago, or the long-term isolation of the entire region from the outside world, which lasted as long as until the 1930s for most of the interior of New Guinea. This review will provide an overview on the genetic aspects of human population history of Oceania and how some of the anthropological peculiarities are reflected in human genetic data. Due to current data availability it will mostly focus on insights from sex-specifically inherited mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomal DNA, whereas more genome-wide autosomal DNA data are soon expected to add additional details or may correct views obtained from these two, albeit highly complex, genetic loci.},

	Abstract = {Located in the Eurasian heartland, Central Asia has played a major role in both the early spread of modern humans out of Africa and the more recent settlements of differentiated populations across Eurasia. A detailed knowledge of the peopling in this vast region would therefore greatly improve our understanding of range expansions, colonizations and recurrent migrations, including the impact of the historical expansion of eastern nomadic groups that occurred in Central Asia. However, despite its presumable importance, little is known about the level and the distribution of genetic variation in this region. We genotyped 26 Indo-Iranian- and Turkic-speaking populations, belonging to six different ethnic groups, at 27 autosomal microsatellite loci. The analysis of genetic variation reveals that Central {A}sian diversity is mainly shaped by linguistic affiliation, with Turkic-speaking populations forming a cluster more closely related to East-{A}sian populations and Indo-Iranian speakers forming a cluster closer to Western Eurasians. The scattered position of Uzbeks across Turkic- and Indo-Iranian-speaking populations may reflect their origins from the union of different tribes. We propose that the complex genetic landscape of Central {A}sian populations results from the movements of eastern, Turkic-speaking groups during historical times, into a long-lasting group of settled populations, which may be represented nowadays by Tajiks and Turkmen. Contrary to what is generally thought, our results suggest that the recurrent expansions of eastern nomadic groups did not result in the complete replacement of local populations, but rather into partial admixture.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 8 September 2010; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2010.153.},

They also observed that the within-population component accounted for 93-95%, and that the among-regions portion was only 3.6%, of the total genetic variance. We have also studied the HGDP-CEPH Diversity Panel (1,064 individuals from 52 populations) with a set of 40 biallelic slow-evolving short insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels). We confirmed the partition of worldwide diversity into five genetic clusters that correspond to major geographic regions. Using the indels we have also disclosed an among-regions component of genetic variance considerably larger (12.1%) than had been estimated using microsatellites. Our study demonstrates that a set of 40 well-chosen biallelic markers is sufficient for the characterization of human population structure at the global level.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimating the historical and demographic parameters that characterize modern human populations is a fundamental part of reconstructing the recent history of our species. In addition, the development of a model of human evolution that can best explain neutral genetic diversity is required to identify confidently regions of the human genome that have been targeted by natural selection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have resequenced 20 independent noncoding autosomal regions dispersed throughout the genome in 213 individuals from different continental populations, corresponding to a total of approximately 6 Mb of diploid resequencing data. We used these data to explore and co-estimate an extensive range of historical and demographic parameters with a statistical framework that combines the evaluation of multiple models of human evolution via a best-fit approach, followed by an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) analysis. From a methodological standpoint, evaluating the accuracy of the parameter co-estimation allowed us to identify the most accurate set of statistics to be used for the estimation of each of the different historical and demographic parameters characterizing recent human evolution. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support a model in which modern humans left Africa through a single major dispersal event occurring approximately 60,000 years ago, corresponding to a drastic reduction of approximately 5 times the effective population size of the ancestral African population of approximately 13,800 individuals. Subsequently, the ancestors of modern Europeans and East {A}sians diverged much later, approximately 22,500 years ago, from the population of ancestral migrants. This late diversification of Eurasians after the African exodus points to the occurrence of a long maturation phase in which the ancestral Eurasian population was not yet diversified.},

	Abstract = {The geographic origin and time of dispersal of Austroasiatic (AA) speakers, presently settled in South and Southeast Asia, remains disputed. Two rival hypotheses, both assuming a demic component to the language dispersal, have been proposed. The first of these places the origin of Austroasiatic speakers in Southeast Asia with a later dispersal to South Asia during the Neolithic, whereas the second hypothesis advocates pre-Neolithic origins and dispersal of this language family from South Asia. To test the two alternative models this study combines the analysis of uniparentally inherited markers with 610,000 common {SNP} loci from the nuclear genome. Indian AA speakers have high frequencies of Y chromosome haplogroup O2a; our results show that this haplogroup has significantly higher diversity and coalescent time (17-28 KYA) in Southeast Asia, strongly supporting the first of the two hypotheses. Nevertheless, the results of principal component and "structure-like" analyses on autosomal loci also show that the population history of AA speakers in India is more complex, being characterised by two ancestral components - one represented in the pattern of Y chromosomal and EDAR results, the other by mtDNA diversity and genomic structure. We propose that AA speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from Southeast Asia, followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations.},

To provide a more extensive and complete sampling of human genetic variation, we have included caste and tribal samples from two states in South India, Daghestanis from eastern Europe, and the Iban from Malaysia. Consistent with observations made by Charles Darwin, our results highlight shared variation among human populations and demonstrate that much genetic variation is geographically continuous. At the same time, principal components analyses reveal discernible genetic differentiation among almost all identified populations in our sample, and in most cases, individuals can be clearly assigned to defined populations on the basis of {SNP} genotypes. All individuals are accurately classified into continental groups using a model-based clustering algorithm, but between closely related populations, genetic and self-classifications conflict for some individuals. The 250K data permitted high-level resolution of genetic variation among Indian caste and tribal populations and between highland and lowland Daghestani populations. In particular, upper-caste individuals from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh form one defined group, lower-caste individuals from these two states form another, and the tribal Irula samples form a third. Our results emphasize the correlation of genetic and geographic distances and highlight other elements, including social factors that have contributed to population structure.},

The individuals were collected as control samples and were genotyped with more than 300 000 {SNP}s in genome-wide association studies using the Illumina Infinium platform. A major East-West gradient from Russian (Moscow) samples to Spanish samples was identified as the first principal component (PC) of the genetic diversity. The second PC identified a North-South gradient from Norway and Sweden to Romania and Spain. Variation of frequencies at markers in three separate genomic regions, surrounding LCT, HLA and HERC2, were strongly associated with this gradient. The next 18 PCs also accounted for a significant proportion of genetic diversity observed in the sample. We present a method to predict the ethnic origin of samples by comparing the sample genotypes with those from a reference set of samples of known origin. These predictions can be performed using just summary information on the known samples, and individual genotype data are not required. We discuss issues raised by these data and analyses for association studies including the matching of case-only cohorts to appropriate pre-collected control samples for genome-wide association studies.},

	Abstract = {Our understanding of the distribution of worldwide human genomic diversity has greatly increased over recent years thanks to the availability of large data sets derived from short tandem repeats (STRs), insertion deletion polymorphisms (indels) and single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s). A concern, however, is that the current picture of worldwide human genomic diversity may be inaccurate because of biases in the selection process of genetic markers (so-called 'ascertainment bias'). To evaluate this problem, we first compared the distribution of genomic diversity between these three types of genetic markers in the populations from the HGDP-CEPH panel for evidence of bias or incongruities. In a second step, using a very relaxed set of criteria to prevent the intrusion of bias, we developed a new set of unbiased STR markers and compared the results against those from available panels. Contrarily to recent claims, our results show that the STR markers suffer from no discernible bias, and can thus be used as a baseline reference for human genetic diversity and population differentiation. The bias on {SNP}s is moderate compared to that on the set of indels analysed, which we recommend should be avoided for work describing the distribution of human genetic diversity or making inference on human settlement history.},

	Abstract = {Migrations to the new world brought together individuals from Europe, Africa and the Americans. Inter-mating between these migrant and indigenous populations led to the subsequent formation of new admixed populations, such as African and Latino Americans. These unprecedented events brought together genomes that had evolved independently on different continents for tens of thousands of years and presented new environmental challenges for the indigenous and migrant populations, as well as their offspring. These circumstances provided novel opportunities for natural selection to occur that could be reflected in deviations at specific locations from the genome-wide ancestry distribution. Here we present an analysis examining European, Native American and African ancestry based on 284 microsatellite markers in a study of {M}exican Americans from the Family Blood Pressure Program. We identified two genomic regions where there was a significant decrement in African ancestry (at 2p25.1, p < 10(-8) and 9p24.1, p < 2 x 10(-5)) and one region with a significant increase in European ancestry (at 1p33, p < 2 x 10(-5)). These locations may harbor genes that have been subjected to natural selection after the ancestral mixing giving rise to {M}exicans.},

@article{Schroeder:2009p585,
	Abstract = {Recently, the observation of a high-frequency private allele, the 9-repeat allele at microsatellite D9S1120, in all sampled Native American and Western Beringian populations has been interpreted as evidence that all modern Native Americans descend primarily from a single founding population. However, this inference assumed that all copies of the 9-repeat allele were identical by descent and that the geographic distribution of this allele had not been influenced by natural selection. To investigate whether these assumptions are satisfied, we genotyped 34 {SNP}s across approximately 500 kilobases (kb) around D9S1120 in 21 Native American and Western Beringian populations and 54 other worldwide populations. All chromosomes with the 9-repeat allele share the same haplotypic background in the vicinity of D9S1120, suggesting that all sampled copies of the 9-repeat allele are identical by descent. Ninety-one percent of these chromosomes share the same 76.26 kb haplotype, which we call the "American Modal Haplotype" (AMH). Three observations lead us to conclude that the high frequency and widespread distribution of the 9-repeat allele are unlikely to be the result of positive selection: 1) aside from its association with the 9-repeat allele, the AMH does not have a high frequency in the Americas, 2) the AMH is not unusually long for its frequency compared to other haplotypes in the Americas, and 3) in Latin American mestizo populations, the proportion of Native American ancestry at D9S1120 is not unusual compared to that observed at other genomewide microsatellites. Using a new method for estimating the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all sampled copies of an allele on the basis of an estimate of the length of the genealogy descended from the MRCA, we calculate the mean time to the MRCA of the 9-repeat allele to be between 7,325 and 39,900 years, depending on the demographic model used. The results support the hypothesis that all modern Native Americans and Western Beringians trace a large portion of their ancestry to a single founding population which may have been isolated from other {A}sian populations prior to expanding into the Americas.},

	Abstract = {A cost-efficient way to increase power in a genetic association study is to pool controls from different sources. The genotyping effort can then be directed to large case series. The Nordic Control database, NordicDB, has been set up as a unique resource in the Nordic area and the data are available for authorized users through the web portal (http://www.nordicdb.org). The current version of NordicDB pools together high-density genome-wide {SNP} information from ∼5000 controls originating from Finnish, Swedish and Danish studies and shows country-specific allele frequencies for {SNP} markers. The genetic homogeneity of the samples was investigated using multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis and pairwise allele frequency differences between the studies. The plot of the first two MDS components showed excellent resemblance to the geographical placement of the samples, with a clear NW-SE gradient. We advise researchers to assess the impact of population structure when incorporating NordicDB controls in association studies. This harmonized Nordic database presents a unique genome-wide resource for future genetic association studies in the Nordic countries.},

	Abstract = {Global human genetic variation is greatly influenced by geography, with genetic differentiation between populations increasing with geographic distance and within-population diversity decreasing with distance from Africa. In fact, these 'clines' can explain most of the variation in human populations. Despite this, population genetics inferences often rely on models that do not take geography into account, which could result in misleading conclusions when working at global geographic scales. Geographically explicit approaches have great potential for the study of human population genetics. Here, we discuss the most promising avenues of research in the context of human settlement history and the detection of genomic elements under natural selection. We also review recent technical advances and address the challenges of integrating geography and genetics.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the bio-geographic ancestry of Argentineans, and quantified their genetic admixture, analyzing 246 unrelated male individuals from eight provinces of three Argentinean regions using ancestry-sensitive DNA markers (ASDM) from autosomal, Y and mitochondrial chromosomes. Our results demonstrate that European, Native American and African ancestry components were detectable in the contemporary Argentineans, the amounts depending on the genetic system applied, exhibiting large inter-individual heterogeneity. Argentineans carried a large fraction of European genetic heritage in their Y-chromosomal (94.1%) and autosomal (78.5%) DNA, but their mitochondrial gene pool is mostly of Native American ancestry (53.7%); instead, African heritage was small in all three genetic systems (<4%). Population substructure in Argentina considering the eight sampled provinces was very small based on autosomal (0.92% of total variation was between provincial groups, p = 0.005) and mtDNA (1.77%, p = 0.005) data (none with NRY data), and all three genetic systems revealed no substructure when clustering the provinces into the three geographic regions to which they belong. The complex genetic ancestry picture detected in Argentineans underscores the need to apply ASDM from all three genetic systems to infer geographic origins and genetic admixture. This applies to all worldwide areas where people with different continental ancestry live geographically close together.},

	Abstract = {A population sample representing the current Swedish population was analysed for maternally and paternally inherited markers with the aim of characterizing genetic variation and population structure. The sample set of 820 females and 883 males were extracted and amplified from Guthrie cards of all the children born in Sweden during one week in 2003. 14 Y-chromosomal and 34 mitochondrial DNA {SNP}s were genotyped. The haplogroup frequencies of the counties closest to Finland, Norway, Denmark and the Saami region in the north exhibited similarities to the neighbouring populations, resulting from the formation of the Swedish nation during the past millennium. Moreover, the recent immigration waves of the 20th century are visible in haplogroup frequencies, and have led to increased diversity and divergence of the major cities. Signs of genetic drift can be detected in several counties in northern as well as in southern Sweden. With the exception of the most drifted subpopulations, the population structure in Sweden appears mostly clinal. In conclusion, our study yielded valuable information of the structure of the Swedish population, and demonstrated the usefulness of biobanks as a source of population genetic research. Our sampling strategy, nonselective on the current population rather than stratified according to ancestry, is informative for capturing the contemporary variation in the increasingly panmictic populations of the world.},

	Abstract = {The goal of the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) was to reconstruct the history of human evolution and the historical and geographical distribution of populations with the help of scientific research. Through this kind of research, the entire spectrum of genetic diversity to be found in the human species was to be explored with the hope of generating a better understanding of the history of humankind. An important part of this genome diversity research consists in taking blood and tissue samples from indigenous populations. For various reasons, it has not been possible to execute this project in the planned scope and form to date. Nevertheless, genomic diversity research addresses complex issues which prove to be highly relevant from the perspective of research ethics, transcultural medical ethics, and cultural philosophy. In the article at hand, we discuss these ethical issues as illustrated by the HGDP. This investigation focuses on the confrontation of culturally diverse images of humans and their cosmologies within the framework of genome diversity research and the ethical questions it raises. We argue that in addition to complex questions pertaining to research ethics such as informed consent and autonomy of probands, genome diversity research also has a cultural-philosophical, meta-ethical, and phenomenological dimension which must be taken into account in ethical discourses. Acknowledging this fact, we attempt to show the limits of current guidelines used in international genome diversity studies, following this up by a formulation of theses designed to facilitate an appropriate inquiry and ethical evaluation of intercultural dimensions of genome research.},

	Abstract = {Identifying the ancestry of chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry has a wide range of applications from disease mapping to learning about history. Most methods require the use of unlinked markers; but, using all markers from genome-wide scanning arrays, it should in principle be possible to infer the ancestry of even very small segments with exquisite accuracy. We describe a method, HAPMIX, which employs an explicit population genetic model to perform such local ancestry inference based on fine-scale variation data. We show that HAPMIX outperforms other methods, and we explore its utility for inferring ancestry, learning about ancestral populations, and inferring dates of admixture. We validate the method empirically by applying it to populations that have experienced recent and ancient admixture: 935 African Americans from the United States and 29 Mozabites from North Africa. HAPMIX will be of particular utility for mapping disease genes in recently admixed populations, as its accurate estimates of local ancestry permit admixture and case-control association signals to be combined, enabling more powerful tests of association than with either signal alone.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human history of Oceania comprises two extremes: the initial colonizations of Near Oceania, one of the oldest out-of-Africa migrations, and of Remote Oceania, the most recent expansion into unoccupied territories. Genetic studies, mostly using uniparentally inherited DNA, have shed some light on human origins in Oceania, particularly indicating that Polynesians are of mixed East {A}sian and Near Oceanian ancestry. Here, we use ∼1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s) to investigate the demographic history of Oceania in a more detailed manner. RESULTS: We developed a new approach to account for {SNP} ascertainment bias, used approximate Bayesian computation simulations to choose the best-fitting model of population history, and estimated demographic parameters. We find that the ancestors of Near Oceanians diverged from ancestral Eurasians ∼27 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting separate initial occupations of both territories. The genetic admixture in Polynesian history between East {A}sians (∼87%) and Near Oceanians (∼13%) occurred ∼3 kya, prior to the colonization of Polynesia. Fijians are of Polynesian (∼65%) and additional Near Oceanian (∼35%) ancestry not found in Polynesians, with this admixture occurring considerably after the initial settlement of Remote Oceania. Our data support a greater contribution of East {A}sian women than men in the admixture history of Remote Oceania and highlight population substructure in Polynesia and New Guinea. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent ascertainment bias, genome-wide {SNP} data provide new insights into the genetic history of Oceana. Our approach to correct for ascertainment bias and obtain reliable inferences concerning demographic history should prove useful in other such studies.},

@article{Calderon:2006p2395,
	Abstract = {An understanding of population relationships in the Mediterranean region is crucial to the reconstruction of recent human evolution. Andalusia, the most southern region of Spain, has been continuously and densely occupied since ancient times and has a rich history of contacts with many different Mediterranean populations. Thus, to understand the Mediterranean peopling process, investigators should analyze the population relationships between the Iberian peninsula and northern Africa based on an assessment of genetic diversity that takes Andalusia into consideration. The aim of this study was to address the extent of genetic variation in the Iberian peninsula between its geographic extremes (Huelva and the Basque area) and to explain the intensity of the phylogenetic relationships between Andalusians and other neighboring populations, such as those from North Africa. We present, for the first time, results on allotype markers (GM and KM) of human immunoglobulins in the Andalusian population from Huelva. The most frequent GM haplotypes in Andalusia correspond to those that are also the most common in Europe. A sub-Saharan haplotype was found at a relatively high frequency compared to other Iberian samples, and a North {A}sian marker did not reach polymorphic frequencies in the study sample. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the first two principal components (94.1% of the total genetic variance) revealed an interesting geographic structure for the 49 populations selected from the literature. The Huelva sample showed a central position in the multivariate space--despite being geographically located at one of the extremes of the Mediterranean basin--and clustered with most Western European populations. Western Europe and Eastern Europe (the latter group paradoxically including Italy and the major islands of the western Mediterranean) were differentiated. North African populations were grouped in two clusters that did not separate either Arabs and Berbers or their present-day countries. Analysis of immunoglobulin allotype markers shows that gene flow among human populations should generally be interpreted in terms of complex patterns, with the observed frequencies being the consequence of the entire genetic and demographic history of the population. Single historical events rarely determine gene frequencies in large human populations. Analysis of the GM system has shown that the Andalusian population from Huelva, as a result of its complex history, is not simply an outstanding part of the Mediterranean world but rather the genetic center of gravity of that world.},

@article{Hofer:2009p599,
	Abstract = {Several studies have found strikingly different allele frequencies between continents. This has been mainly interpreted as being due to local adaptation. However, demographic factors can generate similar patterns. Namely, allelic surfing during a population range expansion may increase the frequency of alleles in newly colonised areas. In this study, we examined 772 STRs, 210 diallelic indels, and 2834 {SNP}s typed in 53 human populations worldwide under the HGDP-CEPH Diversity Panel to determine to which extent allele frequency differs among four regions (Africa, Eurasia, East Asia, and America). We find that large allele frequency differences between continents are surprisingly common, and that Africa and America show the largest number of loci with extreme frequency differences. Moreover, more STR alleles have increased rather than decreased in frequency outside Africa, as expected under allelic surfing. Finally, there is no relationship between the extent of allele frequency differences and proximity to genes, as would be expected under selection. We therefore conclude that most of the observed large allele frequency differences between continents result from demography rather than from positive selection.},

	Abstract = {Accounting for population genetic substructure is important in reducing type 1 errors in genetic studies of complex disease. As efforts to understand complex genetic disease are expanded to different continental populations the understanding of genetic substructure within these continents will be useful in design and execution of association tests. In this study, population differentiation (Fst) and Principal Components Analyses (PCA) are examined using >200 K genotypes from multiple populations of East {A}sian ancestry. The population groups included those from the Human Genome Diversity Panel [Cambodian, Yi, Daur, Mongolian, Lahu, Dai, Hezhen, Miaozu, Naxi, Oroqen, She, Tu, Tujia, Naxi, Xibo, and Yakut], HapMap [ Han Chinese (CHB) and Japanese (JPT)], and East {A}sian or East {A}sian American subjects of Vietnamese, Korean, Filipino and Chinese ancestry. Paired Fst (Wei and Cockerham) showed close relationships between CHB and several large East {A}sian population groups (CHB/Korean, 0.0019; CHB/JPT, 00651; CHB/Vietnamese, 0.0065) with larger separation with Filipino (CHB/Filipino, 0.014). Low levels of differentiation were also observed between Dai and Vietnamese (0.0045) and between Vietnamese and Cambodian (0.0062). Similarly, small Fst's were observed among different presumed Han Chinese populations originating in different regions of mainland of China and Taiwan (Fst's <0.0025 with CHB). For PCA, the first two PC's showed a pattern of relationships that closely followed the geographic distribution of the different East {A}sian populations. PCA showed substructure both between different East {A}sian groups and within the Han Chinese population. These studies have also identified a subset of East {A}sian substructure ancestry informative markers (EASTASAIMS) that may be useful for future complex genetic disease association studies in reducing type 1 errors and in identifying homogeneous groups that may increase the power of such studies.},

We conducted a genotype-phenotype association study in 470 Tanzanians, Kenyans and Sudanese and identified three {SNP}s (G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907) that are associated with lactase persistence and that have derived alleles that significantly enhance transcription from the LCT promoter in vitro. These {SNP}s originated on different haplotype backgrounds from the European C/T-13910 {SNP} and from each other. Genotyping across a 3-Mb region demonstrated haplotype homozygosity extending >2.0 Mb on chromosomes carrying C-14010, consistent with a selective sweep over the past approximately 7,000 years. These data provide a marked example of convergent evolution due to strong selective pressure resulting from shared cultural traits-animal domestication and adult milk consumption.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, data on 20 X-chromosomal microsatellite polymorphisms from the HGDP-CEPH cell line panel are used to infer human population structure. Inferences from these data are compared to those obtained from autosomal microsatellites. Some of the major features of the structure seen with 377 autosomal markers are generally visible with the X-linked markers, although the latter provide less resolution. Differences between the X-chromosomal and autosomal results can be explained without requiring major differences in demographic parameters between males and females. The dependence of the partitioning on the number of individuals sampled from each region and on the number of markers used is discussed.},

We assayed LD in large samples (200 individuals) from each of 11 well-described population isolates and an outbred European-derived sample, using {SNP} markers spaced across chromosome 22. Most isolates show substantially higher levels of LD than the outbred sample and many fewer regions of very low LD (termed 'holes'). Young isolates known to have had relatively few founders show particularly extensive LD with very few holes; these populations offer substantial advantages for genome-wide association mapping.},

	Abstract = {Starch consumption is a prominent characteristic of agricultural societies and hunter-gatherers in arid environments. In contrast, rainforest and circum-arctic hunter-gatherers and some pastoralists consume much less starch. This behavioral variation raises the possibility that different selective pressures have acted on amylase, the enzyme responsible for starch hydrolysis. We found that copy number of the salivary amylase gene (AMY1) is correlated positively with salivary amylase protein level and that individuals from populations with high-starch diets have, on average, more AMY1 copies than those with traditionally low-starch diets. Comparisons with other loci in a subset of these populations suggest that the extent of AMY1 copy number differentiation is highly unusual. This example of positive selection on a copy number-variable gene is, to our knowledge, one of the first discovered in the human genome. Higher AMY1 copy numbers and protein levels probably improve the digestion of starchy foods and may buffer against the fitness-reducing effects of intestinal disease.},

@article{Biswas:2009p2518,
	Abstract = {Studying genomic patterns of human population structure provides important insights into human evolutionary history and the relationship among populations, and it has significant practical implications for disease-gene mapping. Here we describe a principal component (PC)-based approach to studying intracontinental population structure in humans, identify the underlying markers mediating the observed patterns of fine-scale population structure, and infer the predominating evolutionary forces shaping local population structure. We applied this methodology to a data set of 650K {SNP}s genotyped in 944 unrelated individuals from 52 populations and demonstrate that, although typical PC analyses focus on the top axes of variation, substantial information about population structure is contained in lower-ranked PCs. We identified 18 significant PCs, some of which distinguish individual populations. In addition to visually representing sample clusters in PC biplots, we estimated the set of all {SNP}s significantly correlated with each of the most informative axes of variation. These polymorphisms, unlike ancestry-informative markers (AIMs), constitute a much larger set of loci that drive genomic signatures of population structure. The genome-wide distribution of these significantly correlated markers can largely be accounted for by the stochastic effects of genetic drift, although significant clustering does occur in genomic regions that have been previously implicated as targets of recent adaptive evolution.},

@article{Nothnagel:2010p2540,
	Abstract = {The availability of high-density panels of genetic polymorphisms has led to the discovery of extended regions of apparent autozygosity in the human genome. At the genotype level, these regions present as sizeable stretches, or 'runs', of homozygosity (ROH). Here, we investigated both the genomic and the geographic distribution of ROHs in a large European sample of individuals originating from 23 subpopulations. The genomic ROH distribution was found to be characterized by a pattern of highly significant non-uniformity that was virtually identical in all subpopulations studied. Some 77 chromosomal regions contained ROHs at considerable frequency, thereby forming 'ROH islands' that were not explicable by high linkage disequilibrium alone. At the geographic level, the number and cumulative length of ROHs followed a prominent South to North gradient in agreement with expectations from European population history. The individual ROH length, in contrast, showed only minor and unsystematic geographic variation. While our findings are thus consistent with a larger effective population size in Southern than in Northern Europe, combined with a higher historic population density and mobility, they also indicate that the patterns of meiotic recombination in humans must have been very similar throughout the continent. Extending previous reports of a strong correlation between geography and identity-by-state, our data show that the genomic identity-by-descent patterns of Europeans are also clinal. As a consequence, the planning, design and interpretation of ROH-based genetic studies must take sample origin into account in order for such studies to be sensible and valid.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide patterns of variation across individuals provide a powerful source of data for uncovering the history of migration, range expansion, and adaptation of the human species. However, high-resolution surveys of variation in genotype, haplotype and copy number have generally focused on a small number of population groups. Here we report the analysis of high-quality genotypes at 525,910 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}s) and 396 copy-number-variable loci in a worldwide sample of 29 populations. Analysis of {SNP} genotypes yields strongly supported fine-scale inferences about population structure. Increasing linkage disequilibrium is observed with increasing geographic distance from Africa, as expected under a serial founder effect for the out-of-Africa spread of human populations. New approaches for haplotype analysis produce inferences about population structure that complement results based on unphased {SNP}s. Despite a difference from {SNP}s in the frequency spectrum of the copy-number variants (CNVs) detected--including a comparatively large number of CNVs in previously unexamined populations from Oceania and the Americas--the global distribution of CNVs largely accords with population structure analyses for {SNP} data sets of similar size. Our results produce new inferences about inter-population variation, support the utility of CNVs in human population-genetic research, and serve as a genomic resource for human-genetic studies in diverse worldwide populations.},

@article{Jung:2010p2358,
	Abstract = {{SNP} markers provide the primary data for population structure analysis. In this study, we employed whole-genome autosomal {SNP}s as a marker set (54,836 {SNP} markers) and tested their possible effects on genetic ancestry using 320 subjects covering 24 regional groups including Northern (=16) and Southern (=3) {A}sians, Amerindians (=1), and four HapMap populations (YRI, CEU, JPT, and CHB). Additionally, we evaluated the effectiveness and robustness of 50K autosomal {SNP}s with various clustering methods, along with their dependencies on recombination hotspots (RH), linkage disequilibrium (LD), missing calls and regional specific markers. The RH- and LD-free multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) method showed a broad picture of human migration from Africa to North-East Asia on our genome map, supporting results from previous haploid DNA studies. Of the {A}sian groups, the East {A}sian group showed greater differentiation than the Northern and Southern {A}sian groups with respect to Fst statistics. By extension, the analysis of monomorphic markers implied that nine out of ten historical regions in South Korea, and Tokyo in Japan, showed signs of genetic drift caused by the later settlement of East Asia (South Korea, Japan and China), while Gyeongju in South East Korea showed signs of the earliest settlement in East Asia. In the genome map, the gene flow to the Korean Peninsula from its neighboring countries indicated that some genetic signals from Northern populations such as the Siberians and Mongolians still remain in the South East and West regions, while few signals remain from the early Southern lineages.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated human male demographic history using 590 males from 51 populations in the Human Genome Diversity Project - Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain worldwide panel, typed with 37 Y-chromosomal Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and 65 Y-chromosomal Short Tandem Repeats and analyzed with the program Bayesian Analysis of Trees With Internal Node Generation. The general patterns we observe show a gradient from the oldest population time to the most recent common ancestors (TMRCAs) and expansion times together with the largest effective population sizes in Africa, to the youngest times and smallest effective population sizes in the Americas. These parameters are significantly negatively correlated with distance from East Africa, and the patterns are consistent with most other studies of human variation and history. In contrast, growth rate showed a weaker correlation in the opposite direction. Y-lineage diversity and TMRCA also decrease with distance from East Africa, supporting a model of expansion with serial founder events starting from this source. A number of individual populations diverge from these general patterns, including previously documented examples such as recent expansions of the Yoruba in Africa, Basques in Europe, and Yakut in Northern Asia. However, some unexpected demographic histories were also found, including low growth rates in the Hazara and Kalash from Pakistan and recent expansion of the Mozabites in North Africa.},

	Abstract = {It is suggested that the major prehistoric human colonizations of Oceania occurred twice, namely, about 50,000 and 4,000 years ago. The first settlers are considered as ancestors of indigenous people in New Guinea and Australia. The second settlers are Austronesian-speaking people who dispersed by voyaging in the Pacific Ocean. In this study, we performed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) typing on an indigenous Melanesian (Papuan) population, Gidra, and a Polynesian population, Tongans, by using the Affymetrix 500K assay. The {SNP} data were analyzed together with the data of the HapMap samples provided by Affymetrix. In agreement with previous studies, our phylogenetic analysis indicated that indigenous Melanesians are genetically closer to {A}sians than to Africans and European Americans. Population structure analyses revealed that the Tongan population is genetically originated from {A}sians at 70% and indigenous Melanesians at 30%, which thus supports the so-called Slow train model. We also applied the {SNP} data to genome-wide scans for positive selection by examining haplotypic variation and identified many candidates of locally selected genes. Providing a clue to understand human adaptation to environments, our approach based on evolutionary genetics must contribute to revealing unknown gene functions as well as functional differences between alleles. Conversely, this approach can also shed some light onto the invisible phenotypic differences between populations.},

@article{Rosenberg:2005p798,
	Abstract = {Previously, we observed that without using prior information about individual sampling locations, a clustering algorithm applied to multilocus genotypes from worldwide human populations produced genetic clusters largely coincident with major geographic regions. It has been argued, however, that the degree of clustering is diminished by use of samples with greater uniformity in geographic distribution, and that the clusters we identified were a consequence of uneven sampling along genetic clines. Expanding our earlier dataset from 377 to 993 markers, we systematically examine the influence of several study design variables--sample size, number of loci, number of clusters, assumptions about correlations in allele frequencies across populations, and the geographic dispersion of the sample--on the "clusteredness" of individuals. With all other variables held constant, geographic dispersion is seen to have comparatively little effect on the degree of clustering. Examination of the relationship between genetic and geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not as an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs on the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.},

@article{HunterZinck:2010p2363,
	Abstract = {People of the Qatar peninsula represent a relatively recent founding by a small number of families from three tribes of the Arabian Peninsula, Persia, and Oman, with indications of African admixture. To assess the roles of both this founding effect and the customary first-cousin marriages among the ancestral Islamic populations in Qatar's population genetic structure, we obtained and genotyped with Affymetrix 500k {SNP} arrays DNA samples from 168 self-reported Qatari nationals sampled from Doha, Qatar. Principal components analysis was performed along with samples from the Human Genetic Diversity Project data set, revealing three clear clusters of genotypes whose proximity to other human population samples is consistent with Arabian origin, a more eastern or Persian origin, and individuals with African admixture. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) is greater than that of African populations, and runs of homozygosity in some individuals reflect substantial consanguinity. However, the variance in runs of homozygosity is exceptionally high, and the degree of identity-by-descent sharing generally appears to be lower than expected for a population in which nearly half of marriages are between first cousins. Despite the fact that the {SNP}s of the Affymetrix 500k chip were ascertained with a bias toward {SNP}s common in Europeans, the data strongly support the notion that the Qatari population could provide a valuable resource for the mapping of genes associated with complex disorders and that tests of pairwise interactions are particularly empowered by populations with elevated LD like the Qatari.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying the number of deleterious mutations per diploid human genome is of crucial concern to both evolutionary and medical geneticists(1-3). Here we combine genome- wide polymorphism data from PCR- based exon resequencing, comparative genomic data across mammalian species, and protein structure predictions to estimate the number of functionally consequential singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) carried by each of 15 African American (AA) and 20 European American (EA) individuals. We find that AAs show significantly higher levels of nucleotide heterozygosity than do EAs for all categories of functional SNPs considered, including synonymous, non- synonymous, predicted 'benign', predicted 'possibly damaging' and predicted 'probably damaging' SNPs. This result is wholly consistent with previous work showing higher overall levels of nucleotide variation in African populations than in Europeans(4). EA individuals, in contrast, have significantly more genotypes homozygous for the derived allele at synonymous and non- synonymous SNPs and for the damaging allele at ` probably damaging' SNPs than AAs do. For SNPs segregating only in one population or the other, the proportion of non-synonymous SNPs is significantly higher in the EA sample (55.4\%) than in the AA sample (47.0\%; P < 2.33 X 10(-37)). We observe a similar proportional excess of SNPs that are inferred to be 'probably damaging' (15.9\% in EA; 12.1\% in AA; P < 3.33 X 10(-11)). Using extensive simulations, we show that this excess proportion of segregating damaging alleles in Europeans is probably a consequence of a bottleneck that Europeans experienced at about the time of the migration out of Africa.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying the distribution of fitness effects among newly arising mutations in the human genome is key to resolving important debates in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (vertical bar s vertical bar < 0.01\%), 30-42\% are moderately deleterious (0.01\%, vertical bar s vertical bar, 1\%), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal (vertical bar s vertical bar. 1\%). Our results are consistent with 10-20\% of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

	Abstract = {The identification of signals of very recent positive selection provides information about the adaptation of modern humans to local conditions. We report here on a genome-wide scan for signals of very recent positive selection in favor of variants that have not yet reached fixation. We describe a new analytical method for scanning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for signals of recent selection, and apply this to data from the International HapMap Project. In all three continental groups we find widespread signals of recent positive selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed a set of SNPs that can be used to tag the strongest; 250 signals of recent selection in each population.},

	Abstract = {The ability to detect recent natural selection in the human population would have profound implications for the study of human history and for medicine. Here, we introduce a framework for detecting the genetic imprint of recent positive selection by analysing long-range haplotypes in human populations. We first identify haplotypes at a locus of interest (core haplotypes). We then assess the age of each core haplotype by the decay of its association to alleles at various distances from the locus, as measured by extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH). Core haplotypes that have unusually high EHH and a high population frequency indicate the presence of a mutation that rose to prominence in the human gene pool faster than expected under neutral evolution. We applied this approach to investigate selection at two genes carrying common variants implicated in resistance to malaria: G6PD(1) and CD40 ligand(2). At both loci, the core haplotypes carrying the proposed protective mutation stand out and show significant evidence of selection. More generally, the method could be used to scan the entire genome for evidence of recent positive selection.},

But how important is selection, is it really so trivial to understand and what are the alternatives? Here I discuss how genetics is crucial for addressing all of these questions: genetics allowed the concept of natural selection to become viable, it contributed to our understanding of the complexities of selection and it spurred the development of competing models of evolution. Understanding how and why selection acts has important potential applications, from understanding the mechanisms of disease and microbial resistance, to improving the design of transgenes and drugs.},

	Abstract = {Whole-genome sequences provide a rich source of information about human evolution. Here we describe an effort to estimate key evolutionary parameters based on the whole-genome sequences of six individuals from diverse human populations. We used a Bayesian, coalescent-based approach to obtain information about ancestral population sizes, divergence times and migration rates from inferred genealogies at many neutrally evolving loci across the genome. We introduce new methods for accommodating gene flow between populations and integrating over possible phasings of diploid genotypes. We also describe a custom pipeline for genotype inference to mitigate biases from heterogeneous sequencing technologies and coverage levels. Our analysis indicates that the San population of southern Africa diverged from other human populations approximately 108-157 thousand years ago, that Eurasians diverged from an ancestral African population 38-64 thousand years ago, and that the effective population size of the ancestors of all modern humans was ?9,000.},

@article{Li:2011kx,
	Abstract = {The history of human population size is important for understanding human evolution. Various studies have found evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and European populations, associated with the human dispersal out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However, these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer assumptions on population size changes, we present a more detailed history of human population sizes between approximately ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH), a Korean male (SJK), three European individuals (J. C. Venter, NA12891 and NA12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males (NA18507 (ref. 10) and NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very similar population-size histories before 10-20?kyr ago. Both populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10-60?kyr ago, whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck from which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an elevated effective population size between 60 and 250?kyr ago, possibly due to population substructure. We also infer that the differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as early as 100-120?kyr ago, but considerable genetic exchanges may still have occurred until 20-40?kyr ago.},

	Abstract = {Human groups show structured levels of genetic similarity as a consequence of factors such as geographical subdivision and genetic drift. Surveying this structure gives us a scientific perspective on human origins, sheds light on evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and disease, and is integral to effectively carrying out the mission of global medical genetics and personalized medicine. Surveys of population structure have been ongoing for decades, but in the past three years, single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) array technology has provided unprecedented detail on human population structure at global and regional scales. These studies have confirmed well-known relationships between distantly related populations and uncovered previously unresolvable relationships among closely related human groups. SNPs represent the first dense genome-wide markers, and as such, their analysis has raised many challenges and insights relevant to the study of population genetics with whole-genome sequences. Here we draw on the lessons from these studies to anticipate the directions that will be most fruitful to pursue during the emerging whole-genome sequencing era.},

We examined the evidence for classic sweeps in resequencing data from 179 human genomes. As expected under a recurrent-sweep model, we found that diversity levels decrease near exons and conserved noncoding regions. In contrast to expectation, however, the trough in diversity around human-specific amino acid substitutions is no more pronounced than around synonymous substitutions. Moreover, relative to the genome background, amino acid and putative regulatory sites are not significantly enriched in alleles that are highly differentiated between populations. These findings indicate that classic sweeps were not a dominant mode of human adaptation over the past ~250,000 years.},

@article{Allen2010,
	Abstract = {Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P < 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10\% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16\% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20\% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.},

@article{Burke2010,
	Abstract = {Experimental evolution systems allow the genomic study of adaptation, and so far this has been done primarily in asexual systems with small genomes, such as bacteria and yeast. Here we present whole-genome resequencing data from Drosophila melanogaster populations that have experienced over 600 generations of laboratory selection for accelerated development. Flies in these selected populations develop from egg to adult ∼20\% faster than flies of ancestral control populations, and have evolved a number of other correlated phenotypes. On the basis of 688,520 intermediate-frequency, high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify several dozen genomic regions that show strong allele frequency differentiation between a pooled sample of five replicate populations selected for accelerated development and pooled controls. On the basis of resequencing data from a single replicate population with accelerated development, as well as single nucleotide polymorphism data from individual flies from each replicate population, we infer little allele frequency differentiation between replicate populations within a selection treatment. Signatures of selection are qualitatively different than what has been observed in asexual species; in our sexual populations, adaptation is not associated with 'classic' sweeps whereby newly arising, unconditionally advantageous mutations become fixed. More parsimonious explanations include 'incomplete' sweep models, in which mutations have not had enough time to fix, and 'soft' sweep models, in which selection acts on pre-existing, common genetic variants. We conclude that, at least for life history characters such as development time, unconditionally advantageous alleles rarely arise, are associated with small net fitness gains or cannot fix because selection coefficients change over time.},

	Abstract = {Most laboratory evolution studies that characterize evolutionary adaptation genomically focus on genetically simple traits that can be altered by one or few mutations. Such traits are important, but they are few compared with complex, polygenic traits influenced by many genes. We know much less about complex traits, and about the changes that occur in the genome and in gene expression during their evolutionary adaptation. Salt stress tolerance is such a trait. It is especially attractive for evolutionary studies, because the physiological response to salt stress is well-characterized on the molecular and transcriptome level. This provides a unique opportunity to compare evolutionary adaptation and physiological adaptation to salt stress. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a good model system to study salt stress tolerance, because it contains several highly conserved pathways that mediate the salt stress response. We evolved three replicate lines of yeast under continuous salt (NaCl) stress for 300 generations. All three lines evolved faster growth rate in high salt conditions than their ancestor. In these lines, we studied gene expression changes through microarray analysis and genetic changes through next generation population sequencing. We found two principal kinds of gene expression changes, changes in basal expression (82 genes) and changes in regulation (62 genes). The genes that change their expression involve several well-known physiological stress-response genes, including CTT1, MSN4 and HLR1. Next generation sequencing revealed only one high-frequency single-nucleotide change, in the gene MOT2, that caused increased fitness when introduced into the ancestral strain. Analysis of DNA content per cell revealed ploidy increases in all the three lines. Our observations suggest that evolutionary adaptation of yeast to salt stress is associated with genome size increase and modest expression changes in several genes.},

	Abstract = {One approach to understanding the genetic basis of traits is to study their pattern of inheritance among offspring of phenotypically different parents. Previously, such analysis has been limited by low mapping resolution, high labor costs, and large sample size requirements for detecting modest effects. Here, we present a novel approach to map trait loci using artificial selection. First, we generated populations of 10-100 million haploid and diploid segregants by crossing two budding yeast strains of different heat tolerance for up to 12 generations. We then subjected these large segregant pools to heat stress for up to 12 d, enriching for beneficial alleles. Finally, we sequenced total DNA from the pools before and during selection to measure the changes in parental allele frequency. We mapped 21 intervals with significant changes in genetic background in response to selection, which is several times more than found with traditional linkage methods. Nine of these regions contained two or fewer genes, yielding much higher resolution than previous genomic linkage studies. Multiple members of the RAS/cAMP signaling pathway were implicated, along with genes previously not annotated with heat stress response function. Surprisingly, at most selected loci, allele frequencies stopped changing before the end of the selection experiment, but alleles did not become fixed. Furthermore, we were able to detect the same set of trait loci in a population of diploid individuals with similar power and resolution, and observed primarily additive effects, similar to what is seen for complex trait genetics in other diploid organisms such as humans.},

@article{Turner2011,
	Abstract = {Body size is a classic quantitative trait with evolutionarily significant variation within many species. Locating the alleles responsible for this variation would help understand the maintenance of variation in body size in particular, as well as quantitative traits in general. However, successful genome-wide association of genotype and phenotype may require very large sample sizes if alleles have low population frequencies or modest effects. As a complementary approach, we propose that population-based resequencing of experimentally evolved populations allows for considerable power to map functional variation. Here, we use this technique to investigate the genetic basis of natural variation in body size in Drosophila melanogaster. Significant differentiation of hundreds of loci in replicate selection populations supports the hypothesis that the genetic basis of body size variation is very polygenic in D. melanogaster. Significantly differentiated variants are limited to single genes at some loci, allowing precise hypotheses to be formed regarding causal polymorphisms, while other significant regions are large and contain many genes. By using significantly associated polymorphisms as a priori candidates in follow-up studies, these data are expected to provide considerable power to determine the genetic basis of natural variation in body size.},

	Abstract = {Through long-term laboratory selection (over 200 generations), we have generated Drosophila melanogaster populations that tolerate severe, normally lethal, levels of hypoxia. Because of initial experiments suspecting genetic mechanisms underlying this adaptation, we compared the genomes of the hypoxia-selected flies with those of controls using deep resequencing. By applying unique computing and analytical methods we identified a number of DNA regions under selection, mostly on the X chromosome. Several of the hypoxia-selected regions contained genes encoding or regulating the Notch pathway. In addition, previous expression profiling revealed an activation of the Notch pathway in the hypoxia-selected flies. We confirmed the contribution of Notch activation to hypoxia tolerance using a specific $\gamma$-secretase inhibitor, N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), which significantly reduced adult survival and life span in the hypoxia-selected flies. We also demonstrated that flies with loss-of-function Notch mutations or RNAi-mediated Notch knockdown had a significant reduction in hypoxia tolerance, but those with a gain-of-function had a dramatic opposite effect. Using the UAS-Gal4 system, we also showed that specific overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain in glial cells was critical for conferring hypoxia tolerance. Unique analytical tools and genetic and bioinformatic strategies allowed us to discover that Notch activation plays a major role in this hypoxia tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster.},

The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.},

@article{Paterson2010,
	Abstract = {The Red Queen hypothesis proposes that coevolution of interacting species (such as hosts and parasites) should drive molecular evolution through continual natural selection for adaptation and counter-adaptation. Although the divergence observed at some host-resistance and parasite-infectivity genes is consistent with this, the long time periods typically required to study coevolution have so far prevented any direct empirical test. Here we show, using experimental populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its viral parasite, phage Phi2 (refs 10, 11), that the rate of molecular evolution in the phage was far higher when both bacterium and phage coevolved with each other than when phage evolved against a constant host genotype. Coevolution also resulted in far greater genetic divergence between replicate populations, which was correlated with the range of hosts that coevolved phage were able to infect. Consistent with this, the most rapidly evolving phage genes under coevolution were those involved in host infection. These results demonstrate, at both the genomic and phenotypic level, that antagonistic coevolution is a cause of rapid and divergent evolution, and is likely to be a major driver of evolutionary change within species.},

Furthermore, missense changes at 12 of the experimental sites were at residues differing between the parental phages; in ten cases the phiX174 experimental lineages were convergent with the S13 parent, or vice versa, at both the nucleotide and amino-acid levels. Convergence at a site was even obtained in both directions in three cases. These results point to a limited number of pathways taken during evolution in these viruses, and also raise the possibility that much of the amino-acid variation in the natural evolution of these viruses has been selected.},

Another 10 regions displayed strong evidence for ongoing differentiation during the last 10 generations. Many more regions across the genome showed large differences in allele frequency between the lines, indicating that the phenotypic evolution in the lines in 50 generations is the result of an exploitation of standing genetic variation at 100s of loci across the genome.},

	Abstract = {A method was developed to estimate effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL) by maximum likelihood using information from changes of gene frequency at marker loci under selection, assuming an additive model of complete linkage between markers and QTL. The method was applied to data from 16 molecular and coat colour marker loci in mouse lines derived from the F2 of two inbred strains which were divergently selected on 6-week weight for 21 generations. In 4 regions of the genome, marker allele frequencies were more extreme than could be explained by sampling, implying selection at nearby QTL. An effect of about 0.5 standard deviations was located on chromosome 11, and accounted for nearly 10\% of the genetic variance in the base population. QTL with effects as small as 0.2 phenotypic standard deviations could be detected. For typing of a given number of individuals, the power of detection of QTL is very high compared to, for example, analysis of an F2 population. The joint effects of linkage and selection were investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. Marker gene frequencies change little as a consequence of selection at a QTL unless the marker and QTL are less than about 20 cM apart.},

	Abstract = {Identification of genes underlying complex traits is an important problem. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are mapped using marker-trait co-segregation in large panels of recombinant genotypes. Most frequently, recombinant inbred lines derived from two isogenic parents are used. Segregation patterns are also studied in pedigrees from multiple families. Great advances have been made through creative use of these techniques, but narrow sampling and inadequate power represent strong limitations. Here, we propose an approach combining the strengths of both techniques. We established a mapping population from a sample of natural genotypes, and applied artificial selection for a complex character. Selection changed the frequencies of alleles in QTLs contributing to the selection response. We infer QTLs with dense genotyping microarrays by identifying blocks of linked markers undergoing selective changes in allele frequency. We demonstrated this approach with an experimental population composed from 20 isogenic strains. Selection for starvation survival was executed in three replicated populations with three control non-selected populations. Three individuals per population were genotyped using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two regions of the genome, one each on the left arms of the second and third chromosomes, showed significant divergence between control and selected populations. For the former region, we inferred allele frequencies in selected and control populations by pyrosequencing. We conclude that the allele frequency difference, averaging approximately 40\% between selected and control lines, contributed to selection response. Our approach can contribute to the fine scale decomposition of the genetics of direct and indirect selection responses, and genotype by environment interactions.},

We examined the evidence for classic sweeps in resequencing data from 179 human genomes. As expected under a recurrent-sweep model, we found that diversity levels decrease near exons and conserved noncoding regions. In contrast to expectation, however, the trough in diversity around human-specific amino acid substitutions is no more pronounced than around synonymous substitutions. Moreover, relative to the genome background, amino acid and putative regulatory sites are not significantly enriched in alleles that are highly differentiated between populations. These findings indicate that classic sweeps were not a dominant mode of human adaptation over the past ~250,000 years.},

The type of genetic mutation that causes a single amino acid substitution (AAS) in a protein sequence is called a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP). An nsSNP could potentially affect the function of the protein, subsequently altering the carrier's phenotype. This protocol describes the use of the 'Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant' (SIFT) algorithm in predicting whether an AAS affects protein function. To assess the effect of a substitution, SIFT assumes that important positions in a protein sequence have been conserved throughout evolution and therefore substitutions at these positions may affect protein function. Thus, by using sequence homology, SIFT predicts the effects of all possible substitutions at each position in the protein sequence. The protocol typically takes 5-20 min, depending on the input.

Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.},

	Abstract = {New sequencing technologies allow genomic variation to be surveyed in much greater detail than previously possible. While detailed analysis of a single individual typically requires deep sequencing, when many individuals are sequenced it is possible to combine shallow sequence data across individuals to generate accurate calls in shared stretches of chromosome. Here, we show that, as progressively larger numbers of individuals are sequenced, increasingly accurate genotype calls can be generated for a given sequence depth. We evaluate the implications of low-coverage sequencing for complex trait association studies. We systematically compare study designs based on genotyping of tagSNPs, sequencing of many individuals at depths ranging between 2× and 30×, and imputation of variants discovered by sequencing a subset of individuals into the remainder of the sample. We show that sequencing many individuals at low depth is an attractive strategy for studies of complex trait genetics. For example, for disease-associated variants with frequency >0.2%, sequencing 3000 individuals at 4× depth provides similar power to deep sequencing of >2000 individuals at 30× depth but requires only ~20% of the sequencing effort. We also show low-coverage sequencing can be used to build a reference panel that can drive imputation into additional samples to increase power further. We provide guidance for investigators wishing to combine results from sequenced, genotyped, and imputed samples.},

	Abstract = {Frequencies of mutant sites are modeled as a Poisson random field in two species that share a sufficiently recent common ancestor. The selective effect of the new alleles can be favorable, neutral, or detrimental. The model is applied to the sample configurations of nucleotides in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba. Assuming a synonymous mutation rate of 1.5 X 10(-8) per site per year and 10 generations per year, we obtain estimates for the effective population size (N(e) = 6.5 X 10(6)), the species divergence time (t(div) = 3.74 million years), and an average selection coefficient (sigma = 1.53 X 10(-6) per generation for advantageous or mildly detrimental replacements), although it is conceivable that only two of the amino acid replacements were selected and the rest neutral. The analysis, which includes a sampling theory for the independent infinite sites model with selection, also suggests the estimate that the number of amino acids in the enzyme that are susceptible to favorable mutation is in the range 2-23 at any one time. The approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of a 2 X 2 contingency table to compare fixed differences and polymorphic sites with silent sites and amino acid replacements.},

	Abstract = {How much does the intensity of purifying selection vary among populations and species? How uniform are the shifts in selective pressures across the genome? To address these questions, we took advantage of a recent, whole-genome polymorphism data set from two closely related species of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus, paying close attention to the population structure within these species. We found that the average intensity of purifying selection on amino acid sites varies markedly among populations and between species. As expected in the presence of extensive weakly deleterious mutations, the effect of purifying selection is substantially weaker on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating within populations than on SNPs fixed between population samples. Also in accordance with a Nearly Neutral model, the variation in the intensity of purifying selection across populations corresponds almost perfectly to simple measures of their effective size. As a first step toward understanding the processes generating these patterns, we sought to tease apart the relative importance of systematic, genome-wide changes in the efficacy of selection, such as those expected from demographic processes and of gene-specific changes, which may be expected after a shift in selective pressures. For that purpose, we developed a new model for the evolution of purifying selection between populations and inferred its parameters from the genome-wide data using a likelihood approach. We found that most, but not all changes seem to be explained by systematic shifts in the efficacy of selection. One population, the sake-derived strains of S. cerevisiae, however, also shows extensive gene-specific changes, plausibly associated with domestication. These findings have important implications for our understanding of purifying selection as well as for estimates of the rate of molecular adaptation in yeast and in other species.},

Here we leverage the recent mixture of people of African and European ancestry in the Americas to build a genetic map measuring the probability of crossing over at each position in the genome, based on about 2.1 million crossovers in 30,000 unrelated African Americans. At intervals of more than three megabases it is nearly identical to a map built in Europeans. At finer scales it differs significantly, and we identify about 2,500 recombination hotspots that are active in people of West African ancestry but nearly inactive in Europeans. The probability of a crossover at these hotspots is almost fully controlled by the alleles an individual carries at PRDM9 (P?value <?10(-245)). We identify a 17-base-pair DNA sequence motif that is enriched in these hotspots, and is an excellent match to the predicted binding target of PRDM9 alleles common in West Africans and rare in Europeans. Sites of this motif are predicted to be risk loci for disease-causing genomic rearrangements in individuals carrying these alleles. More generally, this map provides a resource for research in human genetic variation and evolution.},

@article{Lohmueller:2011kx,
	Abstract = {A major question in evolutionary biology is how natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation across the human genome. Previous work has documented a reduction in genetic diversity in regions of the genome with low recombination rates. However, it is unclear whether other summaries of genetic variation, like allele frequencies, are also correlated with recombination rate and whether these correlations can be explained solely by negative selection against deleterious mutations or whether positive selection acting on favorable alleles is also required. Here we attempt to address these questions by analyzing three different genome-wide resequencing datasets from European individuals. We document several significant correlations between different genomic features. In particular, we find that average minor allele frequency and diversity are reduced in regions of low recombination and that human diversity, human-chimp divergence, and average minor allele frequency are reduced near genes. Population genetic simulations show that either positive natural selection acting on favorable mutations or negative natural selection acting against deleterious mutations can explain these correlations. However, models with strong positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations and little negative selection predict a stronger negative correlation between neutral diversity and nonsynonymous divergence than observed in the actual data, supporting the importance of negative, rather than positive, selection throughout the genome. Further, we show that the widespread presence of weakly deleterious alleles, rather than a small number of strongly positively selected mutations, is responsible for the correlation between neutral genetic diversity and recombination rate. This work suggests that natural selection has affected multiple aspects of linked neutral variation throughout the human genome and that positive selection is not required to explain these observations.},

The linear birth-death process is used to approximate the dynamics of a rare allele in a finite population. A maximum-likelihood estimate of the age of the allele is obtained by Monte Carlo integration over the coalescence times. The method is applied to two alleles at the cystic fibrosis (CFTR) locus, deltaF508 and G542X, for which intraallelic variability at three intronic microsatellite loci has been examined. Our results indicate that G542X is somewhat older than deltaF508. Although absolute estimates depend on the mutation rates at the microsatellite loci, our results support the hypothesis that deltaF508 arose < 500 generations (approximately 10,000 years) ago.},

	Abstract = {Estimating dispersal distances from population genetic data provides an important alternative to logistically taxing methods for directly observing dispersal. Although methods for estimating dispersal rates between a modest number of discrete demes are well developed, methods of inference applicable to "isolation-by-distance" models are much less established. Here, we present a method for estimating rhosigma(2), the product of population density (rho) and the variance of the dispersal displacement distribution (sigma(2)). The method is based on the assumption that low-frequency alleles are identical by descent. Hence, the extent of geographic clustering of such alleles, relative to their frequency in the population, provides information about rhosigma(2). We show that a novel likelihood-based method can infer this composite parameter with a modest bias in a lattice model of isolation-by-distance. For calculating the likelihood, we use an importance sampling approach to average over the unobserved intraallelic genealogies, where the intraallelic genealogies are modeled as a pure birth process. The approach also leads to a likelihood-ratio test of isotropy of dispersal, that is, whether dispersal distances on two axes are different. We test the performance of our methods using simulations of new mutations in a lattice model and illustrate its use with a dataset from Arabidopsis thaliana.},

	Abstract = {To better understand the forces affecting individual alleles, we introduce a method for finding the joint distribution of the frequency of a neutral allele and the extent of variability at closely linked marker loci (the intraallelic variability). We model three types of intraallelic variability: (a) the number of nonrecombinants at a linked biallelic marker locus, (b) the length of a conserved haplotype, and (c) the number of mutations at a linked marker locus. If the population growth rate is known, the joint distribution provides the basis for a test of neutrality by testing whether the observed level of intraallelic variability is consistent with the observed allele frequency. If the population growth rate is unknown but neutrality can be assumed, the joint distribution provides the likelihood of the growth rate and leads to a maximum-likelihood estimate. We apply the method to data from published data sets for four loci in humans. We conclude that the Delta32 allele at CCR5 and a disease-associated allele at MLH1 arose recently and have been subject to strong selection. Alleles at PAH appear to be neutral and we estimate the recent growth rate of the European population to be approximately 0.027 per generation with a support interval of (0.017-0.037). Four of the relatively common alleles at CFTR also appear to be neutral but DeltaF508 appears to be significantly advantageous to heterozygous carriers.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, there have been major developments of population genetics methods to estimate both rates of recombination and levels of natural selection. However, genomic variants subject to positive selection are likely to have arisen recently and, consequently, had less opportunity to be affected by recombination. Thus, the two processes have an intimately related impact on genetic variation, and inference of either may be vulnerable to confounding by the other. We illustrate here that even modest levels of positive selection can substantially reduce population-based recombination rate estimates. We also show that genome-wide scans to detect loci under recent selection in humans have tended to highlight loci in regions of low recombination, suggesting that confounding by recombination rate may have reduced the power of these studies. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new genome-wide approach for detecting selection, based on the ratio of pedigree-based to population-based estimates of recombination rate. Simulations suggest that our "Ped/Pop" method, which is designed to capture completed sweeps, has good power to discriminate between neutral and adaptive evolution. Unusually for a multimarker method, our approach performs well in regions of high recombination and also has good power for many generations after the fixation of an advantageous variant. We apply the method to human HapMap and Perlegen data sets, finding confirmation of reported candidates as well as identifying new loci that may have undergone recent intense selection.},

The configuration of the data is the number of chromosomes sampled that are in each of a finite set of states. Transitions among states are governed by a Markov chain with transition probabilities dependent on one or more parameters. The method assumes that the joint distribution of coalescence times of the underlying gene genealogy is independent of the genetic state of each lineage. Given a set of coalescence times, the probability that a pair of lineages is chosen to coalesce in each replicate is proportional to the contribution that the coalescence event makes to the probability of the data. This method can be applied to gene genealogies generated by the neutral coalescent process and to genealogies generated by other processes, such as a linear birth-death process which provides a good approximation to the dynamics of low-frequency alleles. Two applications are described. In the first, the fit of allele frequencies at two microsatellite loci sampled in a Sardinian population to the one-step mutation model is tested. The one-step model is rejected for one locus but not for the other. The second application is to low-frequency alleles in a geographically subdivided population. The geographic location is the allelic state, and the alleles are assumed to be sufficiently rare that their dynamics can be approximated by a linear birth-death process in which the birth and death rates are independent of geographic location. The analysis of eight low-frequency allozyme alleles found in the glaucous-winged gull, Larus glaucescens, illustrates how geographically restricted dispersal can be detected.},

@article{Crawford:2004bh,
	Abstract = {Characterizing fine-scale variation in human recombination rates is important, both to deepen understanding of the recombination process(1) and to aid the design of disease association studies(2,3). Current genetic maps show that rates vary on a megabase scale, but studying finer-scale variation using pedigrees is difficult. Sperm-typing experiments(4-6) have characterized regions where crossovers cluster into 1-2-kb hot spots, but technical difficulties limit the number of studies(7). An alternative is to use population variation to infer fine-scale characteristics of the recombination process. Several surveys(8-10) reported block-like patterns of diversity, which may reflect fine-scale recombination rate variation(11-13), but limitations of available methods made this impossible to assess. Here, we applied a new statistical method, which overcomes these limitations, to infer patterns of fine-scale recombination rate variation in 74 genes. We found extensive rate variation both within and among genes. In particular, recombination hot spots are a common feature of the human genome: 47\% (35 of 74) of genes showed substantive evidence for a hot spot, and many more showed evidence for some rate variation. No primary sequence characteristics are consistently associated with precise hot-spot location, although G+C content and nucleotide diversity are correlated with local recombination rate.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge in current biology is to understand the genetic basis of variation for quantitative traits. We review the principles of quantitative trait locus mapping and summarize insights about the genetic architecture of quantitative traits that have been obtained over the past decades. We are currently in the midst of a genomic revolution, which enables us to incorporate genetic variation in transcript abundance and other intermediate molecular phenotypes into a quantitative trait locus mapping framework. This systems genetics approach enables us to understand the biology inside the 'black box' that lies between genotype and phenotype in terms of causal networks of interacting genes.},
